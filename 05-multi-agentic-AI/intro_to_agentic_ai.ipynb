    "# Introduction to Multi Agentic AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this hands-on workshop on Agentic AI systems. In this session, you'll learn how to build an intelligent AI fashion assistant that demonstrates key concepts of agentic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Add\n",
    "\n",
    "An AI agent that can:\n",
    "- Generate images with a chosen wardrobe\n",
    "- Maintain conversation context across multiple interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop focuses on building **agents** rather than simple chatbots. By the end, you'll understand how to create AI systems that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Take advantage of** human in the loop for feedback.\n",
    "2. **Make decisions** based on combined data inputs\n",
    "3. **Talk with other agents** and give feedback\n",
    "3. **Remember context** across multiple conversation turns\n",
    "4. **Reason through multi-step processes** to complete complex tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "- Human in the loop\n",
    "- Multi agentic architectures\n",
    "- Persistent memory systems\n",
    "- Graph-based agent architectures\n",

      "Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that exhibit agency—that is, the capacity to act autonomously, make decisions, and pursue goals in an environment. Unlike passive AI systems that simply respond to inputs or perform predefined tasks, agentic AI can perceive its surroundings, reason about possible actions, and take initiative to achieve objectives, often adapting its behavior based on feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key characteristics of agentic AI include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Autonomy:** The ability to operate without constant human intervention.\n",
      "- **Goal-directed behavior:** Pursuing specific objectives or tasks.\n",
      "- **Perception and reasoning:** Understanding the environment and making decisions accordingly.\n",
      "- **Adaptability:** Learning from experience and adjusting actions to improve outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of agentic AI include autonomous robots, intelligent virtual assistants that proactively manage tasks, and AI agents in simulations or games that plan and execute strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, agentic AI systems act as independent agents capable of making decisions and taking actions to fulfill goals, rather than merely executing programmed instructions.\n"

    "## Human in the Loop with LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "**Human in the loop** refers to the practice of involving humans directly in the decision-making or execution process of an AI system. In LangGraph, this means that at certain points in the agent's workflow, the system can pause and request input, approval, or feedback from a human user before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Human in the Loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quality Control:** Humans can review and correct AI outputs, ensuring higher accuracy.\n",
    "- **Ethical Oversight:** Sensitive or high-stakes decisions can be escalated for human approval.\n",
    "- **Learning and Improvement:** Human feedback can be used to refine agent behavior over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How LangGraph Supports Human in the Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph's graph-based architecture allows you to insert custom nodes where human intervention is required. For example, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pause execution and display intermediate results to a user\n",
    "- Wait for user confirmation before taking an action\n",
    "- Collect additional information or clarification from a human\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enables the creation of robust, safe, and user-aligned agentic systems that combine the strengths of AI automation with human judgment."

    "# Conclusion: Building Effective AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "You have successfully built a complete agentic AI system that demonstrates the core components of modern agent architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Integration**: External API access and structured data querying\n",
    "2. **ReAct Pattern**: Multi-step reasoning with tool orchestration\n",
    "3. **Persistent Memory**: Conversation state management across sessions\n",
    "4. **Graph-Based Architecture**: Structured control flow with conditional routing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Technical Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool-enabled LLMs**: Extending language models with external capabilities\n",
    "2. **State management**: Maintaining context and conversation history\n",
    "3. **Conditional execution**: Dynamic routing based on LLM decisions\n",
    "4. **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when tools fail\n",
    "\n",
    "## Production Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalability**: Consider Redis-based checkpointing for multi-user systems\n",
    "2. **Security**: Implement authentication and input validation for tool access\n",
    "3. **Monitoring**: Add logging and metrics for agent behavior analysis\n",
    "4. **Tool management**: Implement dynamic tool loading and configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further Development Opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhanced tool suite**: Add calendar integration, note-taking, and task management\n",
    "2. **Persistent storage**: Implement SQLite or database-backed memory systems\n",
    "3. **Human feedback loops**: Add approval workflows for high-stakes decisions\n",
    "4. **Structured outputs**: Return JSON responses for API integration\n",
    "5. **Deployment patterns**: Containerize agents for production deployment\n",
    "6. **Multi-agent systems**: Coordinate multiple specialized agents for complex workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "This foundation provides the architectural patterns needed to build sophisticated agent systems for real-world applications."
