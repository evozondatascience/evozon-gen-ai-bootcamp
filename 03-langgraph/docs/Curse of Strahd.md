Barovia: a mysterious and unsettling land, shrouded in mist and isolated from the world beyond. The sky is perpetually overcast, and a heavy sense of foreboding hangs in the air. The landscape is dominated by jagged mountains that loom over dense forests and crumbling villages. The land feels old, as if trapped in time, and every corner seems to whisper of ancient secrets and long-forgotten horrors. Barovia is a place where the past lingers and shadows stretch long, even in the daylight. The roads are often winding and treacherous, and travel between settlements can be slow and perilous. The villages you encounter are small and tightly-knit, each one marked by its own strange and tragic history. The people of Barovia are weary, their faces etched with fear, suspicion, and a quiet resignation to their fate. This land is ruled by an unseen, oppressive force, and while the people endure, it is clear that there is no true hope of escape. Barovia itself seems to be a prison, with no way in or out—and no one truly knows why it is as it is.

There is one name that the people whisper in hushed tones—a name that is both feared and worshipped. It is a name that has haunted Barovia for as long as anyone can remember: ***Strahd***.

In this dreary land, three outsiders meet in a cold, dark, twisted forest:

1. Sallyanne, or Sally for short, is a 19-year-old aasimar woman with a tragic past marked by loss and resilience. Despite her youth, Sally has harnessed the natural world’s power as a Circle of the Moon druid. She possesses the ability to transform into a variety of beasts and command nature itself. Her striking appearance reflects her celestial lineage: glowing golden eyes radiate an inner light, contrasting with her warm, mulatto complexion and blonde dreadlocks tied into a practical ponytail. Petite and lithe, she moves with quiet confidence, dressed in leathers and earthy tones that suit her deep connection to the wilderness. Sallyanne has an air of grief about her that she carries with quiet strength, and the scent of vengeance surrounding her is channelled into her bond with nature and her unyielding will to protect those she cares for.  
2. Tian is a 23-year-old aarakocra with a commanding presence, standing tall with sleek black plumage accented by striking blue tips. His vivid turquoise eyes reflect both intensity and a quiet yearning. His wings are clipped, a practice instilled by his uncle as part of his martial training. Born into a noble family, Tian’s life has been shaped by a duality of purpose. While raised to inherit the responsibilities of his lineage, he was also trained from a young age in martial arts under his uncle’s rigorous guidance. This discipline has honed him into a formidable fighter, capable of exploiting his enemies’ vulnerabilities with precision and skill, relying solely on his bare hands. Despite his noble upbringing, Tian has never felt truly at home within the confines of his privileged life. He carries a restless spirit, torn between the weight of his familial duties and his longing for freedom and a place where he truly belongs. This duality defines him: a, aarakocra born to soar, yet tethered by expectations and a quest for identity.  
3. Teela is a 27-year-old human woman and a fierce barbarian, towering with strength and presence. Her tall, muscular frame is complemented by her bold appearance: short pink hair, braided and tied into a practical bun, frames her striking violet eyes. A prominent scar runs diagonally across her face, starting above her left eye, crossing her nose, and ending on her right cheek. Tribal tattoos beneath her left eye and several facial piercings add to her imposing and distinct look. Teela wields an arsenal of weapons with ease, favouring a massive morningstar that she wields with devastating force. In battle, she surrenders to the chaos, channelling her fury into relentless and reckless strikes that leave her enemies no quarter. Though her combat style is ferocious, her personality is straightforward and sincere—Teela is honest to a fault, trusting, and not overly concerned with cunning or subtlety. While travelling, Teela unwittingly stumbled into the mist-shrouded land of Barovia. Shortly after, she encountered Tian and Sallyanne, instantly deciding that they were her new best friends. Loyal to a fault, she stands by them with unwavering determination, ready to face the dangers of this dark realm head-on.

As the three adventurers start talking about the strangeness of the land, they stumble upon a man killed by wolves. In his pocket, they find a letter written by Kolyan Indirovich:

*“Hail thee of might and valour,*

*I, the Burgomeister of Barovia, send you honour – with despair. My daughter, the fair Ireena Kolyana, has been, these past nights, bitten by a vampyr. Since forever, this creature has drained the life blood of my people. Now my dear Ireena languishes and dies from an unholy wound caused by this vile beast. He has become too powerful to conquer.*

*So I say to you, give us up for dead and encircle this land with the symbols of good. Let holy men call upon their power that the devil may be contained within the walls of weeping Barovia. Leave our sorrows to our graves, and save the world from this evil fate of ours.*

*There is much wealth entrapped in this community. Return for your reward after we are all departed for a better life.*

*Kolyan Indirovich”*

The three adventurers make their way into the Village of Barovia. Nestled in a valley surrounded by towering, darkened mountains, the Village of Barovia is a quiet, desolate place. The homes are small, simple, and weathered by time, their thatched roofs sagging under the weight of years. The cobbled streets are often damp and covered in a thin layer of fog that lingers even on the clearest of days. A strange heaviness hangs in the air, as though the village itself has been suspended in a timeless, uneasy stasis.

The people of Barovia are a sombre lot, with many keeping to themselves and avoiding eye contact. Their expressions are weary, and a deep sadness seems to pervade every conversation. It’s clear that they live in the shadow of something far greater than any local trouble—a feeling that something oppressive is always watching, always present. Though there are children in the village, they are few, and they seem to grow up quickly, their youthful joy quickly replaced by the same grim resignation as the adults.

The buildings are spread haphazardly across the village, and the village square seems to be the only place where people gather in any number, though even there, conversations are quiet and fleeting. A single road leads deeper into Barovia, shrouded by the ever-present mist that seems to cling to the land. The air smells faintly of wet earth and decay.

In the heart of the village stands the Burgomaster's Mansion, an imposing structure, though it looks as if it has long since lost its grandeur. It looms over the rest of the village, a reminder of a bygone era when the settlement was perhaps more prosperous—or at least, less burdened by the invisible weight that hangs over it now.

In the Village, the party immediately meets Morgantha. She is a haggard, elderly woman with a crooked back and a wrinkled face that speaks of many years lived in hardship. Her skin is pale and mottled, with deep lines etched into her features. Her eyes are sharp and calculating, shining with a cold, unsettling gleam. She wears tattered clothing, and her long, grey hair is tangled and unkempt, giving her an even more dishevelled appearance. 

She is selling her “dream pastries” to the villagers, who eagerly queue up to buy them. They tell the party that the pastries are the only thing that allow them to dream of a better, happier place. Morgantha comments on Tian’s unusual nature, noting that aarakocra have never been seen in these lands. She initially asks Teela if Tian is her pet, leaving Teela to be horrified and explain that he is a person, not an animal. Morgantha offers the party some of her pastries, and Teela quickly buys one and eats it, while Sally takes a bite as well.

Next, the party visits the Church of the Morninglord, where they meet Father Donavich, the village's despondent priest. He reveals that his son, Doru, has been turned into a vampire spawn. Father Donavich has locked Doru in the cellar beneath his room, hoping to eventually find a way to cure him.

After some persuasion, Father Donavich allows the party to visit Doru. In the cellar, Doru, now a feral, starved vampire spawn, immediately attacks, driven mad by hunger. The party manages to calm him, promising to feed him in exchange for information. Reluctantly, Doru explains that he was part of an uprising against Strahd a year ago. The rebellion failed, and he was turned into a vampire spawn and released. He returned home, where his father imprisoned him.

The party then heads to the Blood on the Vine Tavern, the only inn in the village, where they meet Ismark Kolyanovich, the son of the recently deceased burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich. Ismark tells the party that he needs their help to protect his sister, Ireena. Two years ago, Ireena was bitten twice by Strahd, the ancient vampire lord of Barovia, and Ismark fears for her safety now that their father has passed away.

The party agrees to Izmark's request and accompanies him to his house. On the way, he shares his distrust of two people that were in the tavern when they met, explaining that they are Vistani. Izmark believes all Vistani are spies for Strahd and refuses to discuss anything of importance in their presence, fearing they will turn him over to the vampire lord.

As they travel, the party encounters many "shells"—people who have been drained by vampires too many times and lost their souls in the process. These hollow beings move aimlessly, devoid of purpose or desire.

Upon reaching the mansion, the party meets Ireena, Izmark’s sister. She is visibly paranoid and terrified of Strahd's obsession with her. Ireena is a strikingly beautiful young woman, in her early twenties, with a graceful yet determined presence. Her long auburn hair falls in waves down her shoulders, framing a face marked by both strength and sorrow. Her sharp, intelligent green eyes hold the weight of someone who has experienced more than her years should allow. There is a quiet intensity about her—an aura of someone both haunted and resolute. She stands tall, her posture reflecting resilience, though it’s clear she carries a heavy burden. Ireena recalls that the last time she met Strahd, his eyes were terribly charming.

Izmark continues, explaining that Strahd is the oldest and most powerful vampire in the land. He is the ruler of Barovia, and he has set his sights on Ireena. Izmark doesn’t believe it’s possible to oppose Strahd, but he cannot abandon his sister to her fate. He asks the party to escort her to Vallaki, the largest town in Barovia, where the Church of St. Andral offers a safe haven.

A frantic woman named Mary approaches Izmark, pleading for his help in finding her missing daughter, Gertruda. The ten-year-old girl disappeared some time ago, and Mary hasn’t seen her since. After Mary leaves, Ireena comments that Gertruda hasn’t been seen for a while. If she were still alive, she would be around sixteen years old.

The next day, the party helps bury Izmark’s recently deceased father, Kolyan Indirovich. As they finish the funeral rites, they notice a dark, imposing figure watching the proceedings from afar. The figure, regal and solemn, bows its head at the end of the ceremony before dissipating into mists. 

After the burial, the party sets out from the village and begins their journey to Vallaki, with Ireena in tow. Along the way, they reach the Vistani camp at Tser’s Pool. The Vistani are a friendly and welcoming people, open to everyone, including Strahd. While not all of them work for the vampire lord, some do. The Vistani are also the only people allowed to leave Barovia, as they are the only ones who can navigate through the mists.

At Tser’s Pool, the party meets Araja, the leader of the Vistani camp. Araja is a cheerful, rotund man who shares drinks and stories with the party and invites them to camp with his people. They also meet his wife, Rina, who can hold her liquor better than he can, and Stanimir, a master storyteller among the Vistani.

Stanimir begins to share the tale of how the Vistani helped Strahd, their Dark Prince, long ago.

Strahd was a foreign prince and conqueror. When he arrived in this land, he met opposition from its original inhabitants: the druids who worshipped the Rozanas, the Ladies Three, the Order of the Silver Dragon based in Argynvostholt, and the Vistani. While the Vistani remained neutral, the Order of the Silver Dragon provided the fiercest resistance. In the final battle, Strahd was gravely wounded and would have perished, but the Vistani took his body from the battlefield and tended to his injuries. This act of mercy is why Strahd holds a deep gratitude toward the Vistani people and made them a promise: no creature in this land would harm them. Additionally, they are allowed to leave Barovia—an exclusive privilege extended to no other people.

The party is then told of Madame Eva, the oldest and most powerful *"rauni"*– the Vistani word for a seer, who has the ability to see the threads of fate. They are directed to her caravan to seek a reading. Upon arriving, they enter the caravan and meet Madame Eva herself.

Though her age is difficult to pinpoint, her features are marked by the wisdom and experience of a long life, and her eyes—sharp and penetrating—seem to peer into the very souls of those who meet her gaze. She is rarely seen without her brightly coloured shawl and flowing robes, which bear intricate patterns and symbols that seem to shift in the flickering light of the campfire or candle beside her.

Her hair, though streaked with silver, is often tied back in a loose braid, and her wrinkled hands are adorned with various rings—each one seemingly holding a story of its own. She is never without her crystal ball, an object of great significance, which she uses in mysterious ways to commune with forces beyond the understanding of most mortals.

Despite her age and frail appearance, Madame Eva possesses an uncanny vitality and sharpness. Her voice is deep, soothing, and often carries an air of both mystery and authority, as though she has lived through countless trials and seen more of the world than most could comprehend. There is something undeniably captivating about her presence, and though she speaks cryptically at times, her words always seem to carry weight.

Eva looks at Ireena and exclaims that she is the *"31st."* No one fully understands the meaning of this declaration, but rather than explain herself Eva, proceeds to shuffle her tarokka deck and give the party a reading for their journey through these lands:

* **The 9 of Swords**: Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy. There is a town where all is not well; within it, you will find a house of corruption, and inside, a dark room full of restless ghosts.  
* **The 1 of Swords**: This card speaks of a powerful force of good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope. The treasure lies within a dragon's house, in hands once pure but now corrupted.  
* **The 5 of Stars**: A card of power and strength, it represents a weapon of vengeance—a sword of sunlight. The treasure is hidden in a small castle beneath a mountain, guarded by amber giants.  
* **The Mists**: This card reveals someone who will greatly aid you in the battle against darkness—a Vistana wandering alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at St. Markovia's Abbey in Kresk, near the mists.  
* **The Marionette**: Your enemy is a creature of darkness, with powers far beyond mortality. This card foretells the place where the end will begin. Look to great heights, and you will find the beating heart of the castle.

Madame Eva also gives each member of the party their individual readings:

* **Teela**: "Your mind is shattered, and your past is wrapped in mist. You have found the pair of queens; seek the one whose hand you hold while surrounded by a child’s plea for mercy."  
* **Tian**: "You have never known the feeling of home—pushed away and shunned. You are plagued by an illness you do not yet understand. If a cure you seek, the keepers guard the way."  
* **Sallyanne**: "Your childhood home was taken from you, and your blood was the reason. Look towards the Ladies; you, the purifier of lands, will find your eyes opened, even though they were once closed."

After receiving their readings, the party spends the night in the Vistani camp. The next morning, they set off toward Vallaki, taking the Old Svalich Road.

Along the way, Sally sees a disturbing vision: gallows with her own body swinging in the ghostly wind. When she looks closer, the body vanishes, leaving the noose empty. When she blinks again, the gallows themselves are gone.

The party arrives at the Old Bonegrinder, a mill situated between Tser's Pool and Vallaki. With nightfall approaching and Ireena warning them of the dangers of travelling in the dark in Barovia, they decide to stop there for the evening.

As they approach the mill, a raven pulls at Teela’s hair, as if trying to pull her back. Unperturbed by the small creature, Teela shoos it away, and the party proceeds inside.

Inside the mill, they meet Ophelia and Bella, the daughters of Morgantha, the woman they encountered in the Village of Barovia selling dream pastries. The sisters are waiting for Morgantha’s return and invite the party to wait as well.

The sisters engage the party in small talk, mentioning a man named Vasilli who brings children to the mill to foster. They explain that they take despondent, orphaned children, teaching them how to bake so they can make a living for themselves.

The mill is indeed producing pastries, and the party notices various ingredients used in baking. Curious, Tian—being a novice cook—inspects the kitchen to understand what makes the pies so exceptional. He is horrified by what he finds: children's bones, picked clean and ready to be ground.

When he questions the two sisters about the bones, they initially try to evade the subject. However, the truth eventually comes out: the secret to the dream pastries' effectiveness lies in the ground bones of children, which are mixed into the dough. The children they foster are, in fact, killed for their bones to be used as ingredients.

A fight breaks out between the party and the sisters, during which it is revealed that Ophelia and Bella are actually green hags, and that Morgantha is also a green hag, with the three of them forming a coven.

After a hard-fought battle, the party manages to kill Ophelia and Bella, just in time to see Morgantha approaching the Bonegrinder, two children in tow. The party takes positions to confront her, but still weakened from the battle, they quickly find themselves at a disadvantage.

As the fight turns against them, Ireena takes the two children and escapes through an open window. The party begins to flee as well, but Morgantha casts a **Lightning Bolt**, electrocuting the entire group.

As they collapse, unconscious from the attack, they hear Morgantha arguing with someone—defending her actions and begging for mercy, claiming she didn’t know.

The last thing the party sees before falling unconscious is the vague silhouette of Strahd von Zarovich, looming over them.

As the party regains consciousness and begins to gather their bearings, they look up to find Strahd von Zarovich watching them with a vague, amused expression. He explains that they are now in his domain, and their presence will serve to entertain him. He shares that, being ancient and the very embodiment of the land, life can grow monotonous, and the presence of outsiders brings him some amusement.

Strahd then presents each party member with a magical item to aid them in facing the dangers of Barovia, requesting something in return. While Sally and Teela offer him mundane items, Tian gives him a personal possession—a keepsake given to him by his uncle.

Strahd’s gaze then shifts to Ireena, and he beckons her closer. With a glance, he mesmerises her, his vampire gaze pulling her toward him. As Ireena steps forward, Strahd remarks on the uncanny resemblance she bears, but after a moment, he releases her. Before he vanishes into the mists, he tells the party that he expects great things from them.

As he disappears, the party realises that Strahd was the misty figure they had seen earlier at Kolyan Indirovich’s funeral.

The party gathers themselves after the encounter and works to calm Ireena, who is frantic and has no memory of the events that have unfolded. As they take stock of their situation, they notice that the children they had saved from Morgantha had been left behind when Strahd rescued them. 

Ireena reveals that Tian won’t be allowed into Vallaki because of his appearance. To solve this, the party decides to disguise him in old clothes, bandages and a mask, claiming he is a survivor of a terrible fire, his body horribly burned and requiring him to stay cloaked at all times.

With their plans in place, they trudge toward Vallaki, their spirits low. 

As the party approaches Vallaki for the first time, they are greeted by an eerie sight: a walled town, its towering gates looming ahead, seemingly standing against the oppressive gloom of Barovia. The air is thick with a sense of both weariness and hidden tension, as if the town itself is holding its breath.

Upon arrival, they are stopped by the night guards, George and John, who refuse them entry due to the late hour, despite Ireena's insistence and her noble pedigree. The party is forced to sleep in a dusty room. 

They are also given a stern reminder of Vallaki’s laws, some of which seem outright odd:

* Speaking the name of the Devil, Strahd, aloud is a crime punishable by imprisonment.  
* Happiness is believed to ward off the Devil, so all residents are required to be cheerful and maintain a smile at all times.  
* Those found to be unhappy will be charged with "malicious unhappiness" and imprisoned.  
* The weekly festivals in Vallaki are considered the best defence against the Devil. Attendance is mandatory for all.  
* None shall defame or slander the Baron  
* None shall defame or slander the Festivals

They warn the party that any deliberate violations would result in jail time. Their weapons were duly noted by the authorities.

The town is large and bustling, but there’s a strange emptiness to the streets. Buildings, though sturdy, appear worn and aged, their wood warped from years of exposure to the constant mist and dreary skies. Many houses are adorned with faded banners, their once-bright colours now muted, and the windows of the buildings are often shuttered or closed tightly. The occasional flicker of light from inside suggests life, though it seems restrained and cautious.

The cobbled streets are often uneven, with a sense of neglect beneath the seemingly orderly facade. The sound of distant voices and the creaking of wagons can be heard, but there’s a strange stillness in the air that makes the town feel both alive and lifeless at once. The residents, when seen, tend to keep to themselves, casting furtive glances or smiling strangely as they go about their business.

The atmosphere is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying wood, mingling with the faint, acrid hint of burning wood that seems ever-present. A sense of unease clings to the place, and while Vallaki might appear like any other town at first glance, there is an undeniable aura of oppression, as if it is constantly under the watchful eye of something unseen.

Ireena suggests they formally announce their presence to the Burgomaster, Vargas Vallakovich, so they make their way to his mansion.

On the way through the city center, they encounter a disturbing sight: cages filled with people, starved and dehydrated, some bloodied and bruised, their heads grotesquely adorned with donkey masks. Gallows stand in the square, likely for public executions, and all around them, the townsfolk wear wide, unsettling smiles that fail to reach their eyes. Preparations for the upcoming Festival of the Blazing Sun are underway.

A woman preaches about *“the Purge”*, an event she claims will bring back the sun. Before she can finish her message, a guard swiftly beats her into silence. As she is subdued, she spits at the party, calling them “loyalists.”

When they finally reach the Burgomaster’s house, they are ushered inside by Lydia Vallakovich, Vargas’s wife. She appears jittery and fearful, trying to present an image of a happy marriage, but it is clear her relationship with Vargas is far from ideal. She recoils at the sight of a glass of spilled water, an odd reaction that speaks volumes about her distress.

Inside, they meet Vargas, a rotund, foolish man who believes that laughter is the key to keeping Strahd at bay—hence his decree making the city’s festivals mandatory. Vargas reveals that he wants the party to investigate Lady Wachter, his political rival, who openly opposes his rule. Lady Wachter refuses to attend the festivals, claiming she is caring for her sick daughter, though Vargas believes this is a lie.

He also suspects that Lady Wachter is the leader of the cultists preaching about the Purge. Additionally, two of his household staff have gone missing, and he suspects her involvement in their disappearance.

The party then makes their way to the Cathedral of St. Andral, as Father Donavich advises Ireena. The church is considered hallowed ground, a sanctuary where evil cannot enter.

The Church of St. Andral stands at the edge of Vallaki, a sombre but imposing structure that seems to resist the oppressive gloom of Barovia. Its high, pointed steeple stretches upward, piercing the grey sky, while its thick stone walls provide a sense of permanence against the ever-present mist that rolls through the land. The church is old, its weathered exterior a mix of grey stone and dark timber, with ivy creeping up its walls and winding around the base of the steeple. A worn but solid wooden door, adorned with simple carvings, leads the way into the building, though the hinges creak when it is opened, as if the church itself is reluctant to reveal its secrets.

As the party steps inside, they are greeted by the cool, musty air of the interior, carrying the faint scent of aged wood, incense, and the dryness of stone. The floors are made of worn, uneven flagstones, their surface polished by years of use but showing signs of age. The main hall is dimly lit by flickering candlelight and stained-glass windows, their colours muted by the dullness of the light filtering through the ever-clouded sky. The windows depict various religious scenes, their once-vibrant hues faded and chipped, but still recognizable.

The atmosphere within the church is heavy with reverence and a quiet sadness, as though the building has long been a place of solace for the weary and a refuge from the outside world. A large altar at the far end of the nave is draped in simple cloth, with a faint glow from the candles surrounding it casting soft shadows across the stone walls. The air here feels sacred, yet there’s a sense that something is amiss—something hidden beneath the surface of the sanctuary. Despite its calm exterior, the church exudes an underlying tension, as if it is holding onto something just out of reach.

There are few inhabitants within, but the soft murmur of prayer or quiet conversation can be heard echoing off the walls. A sense of isolation permeates the space, as though the church is both a sanctuary and a prison, offering refuge while reminding those who enter that the outside world is one they may never fully escape.

There, they meet Father Lucian and the altar boy, Yeska. 

Father Lucian Petrovich is a man in his early fifties, with the weight of many years and burdens etched into his features. His tall, thin frame is draped in the simple robes of his station, a deep grey garment that bears the faintest traces of age and wear. His face is pale, almost ghostly, with sharp, angular features, though his eyes are what stand out the most—intense and weary, yet there is a flicker of kindness hidden beneath the surface, tempered by the harshness of his life in Barovia.

His hair, once dark, is now streaked with grey, and his beard is kept short and neat, though it too has begun to show signs of age. His skin is fair but has a weathered look, as though constantly exposed to the dampness and gloom of the land. His hands, though steady, are calloused, likely from years of service in the church and the hardships that come with living in such a grim place.

Despite the calm exterior, there is a palpable tension to his posture, as though he is always on edge, waiting for something. His eyes, while compassionate, also carry the weight of sorrow, as if he has seen too much suffering and loss to remain unaffected. The lines on his face tell of sleepless nights and the toll that leading a congregation in such a forsaken place has taken on him.

When he speaks, his voice is quiet, measured, but with an underlying strength—a man who has endured and continues to endure, even in the face of despair. His demeanour reflects both his role as a priest and the personal sacrifices he has made to serve the people of Barovia.

Yeska, the altar boy at the Church of St. Andral, is a young boy, no older than seven, with a gaunt, almost fragile appearance. His frame is slight, his shoulders slightly hunched as if he’s accustomed to carrying a weight far beyond his years. His skin is pale, with a sickly pallor that speaks of long days spent indoors, away from the life-giving sun, under the ever-present gloom of Barovia.

His hair is dark and unkempt, falling in disarray around his forehead, and his eyes are wide, perpetually shadowed by a mixture of exhaustion and fear. They seem to dart nervously from one place to another, betraying a deep unease as if he is constantly on alert, anticipating something terrible just beyond his reach. Despite his youthful age, there’s a weariness in his gaze, a resignation that comes from enduring too much for too long.

Yeska’s clothing is simple and modest, typical of the altar boy’s role, though it appears slightly too big for him, giving him a dishevelled look. His hands, while still youthful, are stained with the marks of labour, perhaps from tending to the altar or other duties within the church. His movements are quick and fidgety, as though he is always trying to avoid being noticed or seeking refuge in the shadows.

There is a haunted quality to his demeanour, an almost palpable sense of dread that clings to him, as though he knows more than he is willing—or able—to reveal. His quiet, hesitant manner only adds to the sense that he is a boy trapped between his innocence and the harsh realities of the dark world around him. 

The party begins speaking with Father Lucian, who, after a discussion with Ireena, agrees to show them the crypt beneath the altar where the bones of St. Andral are usually kept. These bones, he explains, are the source of the church's sanctity. However, Father Lucian reveals that the bones were stolen during the last festival, leaving both the church and Ireena vulnerable.

Father Lucian implores the party to investigate the theft and recover the bones. He admits that the existence of the relics was a closely guarded secret, known only to himself and Yeska, the altar boy. Despite this, Yeska refuses to speak about the theft, leading Father Lucian to suspect that the boy may have betrayed the secret.

Lucian also shares that children have been going missing in Vallaki and urges the party to speak with Milivoj, the gravedigger, and Claudia Belasco, the orphanage headmistress, for more information. When Teela mentions Morgantha’s grim practice of using children’s bones to make pies, Father Lucian collapses in uncontrollable sobs, overwhelmed by the revelation. The weight of the situation becomes painfully clear to everyone.

The party waits patiently for Father Lucian to regain his composure. Once he does, they press him for more details about the disappearance of the bones. He explains that he last checked on the relics five days ago during his morning prayers. When he returned the following day, they were gone. There were no signs of forced entry into the crypt.

As the conversation continues, Father Lucian shares that Yeska has been under his care since infancy. The boy’s mother tragically took her own life in front of the church dais after bringing Yeska to the church. The party also learns about Milivoj, the church gravedigger, who was supposed to come to the church three days ago but hasn’t shown up.

The discussion shifts to unsettling rumors about the Reformation Camps, facilities run by the Burgomaster and his guards, from which people rarely return unscathed. Father Lucian also speaks of Izek, the captain of the guard, who was adopted by the Burgomaster, Vargas Vallakovich, after wolves killed his family.

Yeska confesses to the party that he told Milivoj and another orphan—a lanky, yellow-haired boy—about something holy hidden beneath the church.

While in the church, a woman kneeling in prayer introduces herself as Wilhelmina Rivanova. She explains that her son, Udo Lucovich, was arrested for "malicious unhappiness," his home burned as punishment, and his whereabouts remain unknown. Wilhelmina pleads with the party to keep an eye out for her son.

Leaving the church, the party heads toward the Blue Water Inn, owned by the Martikov family. On the way, a beggar approaches Tian, clutching his arm and ranting about how “it has begun” while mentioning purple lights emanating from the burgomaster’s house. Guards quickly intervene, dragging the man away.

Outside the inn, the party encounters a poor puppeteer giving a clumsy performance. The elvish-looking man piques their interest when he invites them for a drink later that evening.

Inside the inn, the party meets Dannika Martikov, the sharp-witted owner, and her husband, Urvin, who is less business-savvy but an exceptional cook.

Dannika Martikov is a middle-aged woman with an air of warmth and resilience, reflecting her role as the matron of the Blue Water Inn. She has dark, wavy hair streaked lightly with silver, often tied back to keep it out of her face while she works. Her sharp, intelligent eyes suggest a quick wit and a natural curiosity about the world around her. Dressed in simple yet practical attire, she moves with purpose and confidence, embodying the spirit of someone used to running a bustling establishment. Her demeanour is approachable, with a steady presence that makes her a natural leader within her family and the inn.

Urwin Martikov is a stout, middle-aged man with a slightly rugged appearance that reflects years of hard work at the Blue Water Inn. His dark, neatly trimmed beard frames a face lined with laugh lines and hints of weariness, speaking to both the joys and challenges of his life. His deep-set, thoughtful eyes carry a quiet warmth, often softened by a gentle smile. Urwin's clothing is practical and modest, typically consisting of sturdy fabrics suited to running an inn. Though less outgoing than his wife, he exudes a calming, dependable presence, particularly in the kitchen, where his skill as a cook is evident.

During the conversation, Dannika expresses her concern about a delayed wine shipment from the Wizard of Wines, a vineyard managed by another branch of her family. With the upcoming festival, the shortage threatens to tarnish the Martikovs’ reputation.

The party also meets Dannika’s two young sons, Bram and Bray, who are mesmerized by Tian’s impressive martial displays.

Bram and Bray Martikov are energetic young boys, close in age, with features that unmistakably mark them as siblings. Both have tousled dark hair and wide, curious eyes that sparkle with mischief and wonder. Their cheeks are often flushed from running around the Blue Water Inn, and their simple, practical clothes frequently show signs of their active play, like smudges of dirt or loose threads.

Bram, the older of the two, exudes a slightly more confident and adventurous spirit, while Bray tends to follow his brother’s lead, observing with quieter curiosity. Together, they bring a lively energy to the inn, often delighting guests with their playful antics.

The curious elf from before, joins them at their table. He introduces himself as Rictavio, storyteller extraordinaire. Rictavio is a middle-aged elvish man with a roguish charm and a flair for the dramatic. He has shoulder-length salt-and-pepper hair that is swept back, giving him a distinguished yet rakish appearance. His sharp, expressive eyes are full of curiosity and mischief, suggesting a keen intellect and a knack for storytelling.

He dresses in colourful, flamboyant attire befitting his role as a travelling entertainer. His outfit includes a vibrant doublet, a wide-brimmed hat adorned with a feather, and boots that seem well-worn from extensive travel. He carries a cane, though it seems more for show than necessity, and his demeanour is one of easy confidence. Rictavio’s smile is quick and warm, often accompanied by an air of mystery that leaves those he meets wondering if there is more to him than meets the eye.

He warmly greets the party, clearly excited to make their acquaintance. With genuine interest, he asks about their adventures, listening intently to their stories and engaging in lively conversation. As Dannika passes by their table, he greets her with familiarity, hinting at a previous connection and revealing that he’s a regular at the inn. After some friendly chatter, Rictavio assures the group that their paths will cross again soon and expresses his belief that a beautiful friendship is on the horizon. With a charming smile, he bids them farewell and leaves them to their own devices.

At a nearby table, two hunters, Szoldar Szoldarovich and Yevgeni Krushkin, pore over a map. Teela and Sallyanne’s attempts to engage the hunters are far from smooth, but the party manages to overhear their conversation about Bluto, a fisherman who has been missing for four days. Bluto, devastated by his wife’s death a year ago, recently claimed to have a good luck charm before disappearing.

The hunters also mention Milivoj, prompting the party to follow them to the orphanage. At the orphanage, the party witnesses Claudia Belasco, the matron, speaking to a carpenter delivering a child-sized coffin.

Claudia Belasco is a stern, no-nonsense woman in her late middle age, with a demeanour shaped by decades of responsibility at the orphanage. Her greying hair is pulled back into a tight bun, emphasising her sharp, angular features and piercing eyes that seem to scrutinise everything and everyone around her. She dresses plainly, in practical and slightly worn clothing, reflecting her focus on the orphanage's needs rather than her own appearance. Though her expression is often serious, there is an underlying weariness to her posture, hinting at the weight of the burdens she carries. Despite her stern exterior, there’s a quiet determination in her manner that speaks to her dedication to protecting the children under her care.

The hunters inform Claudia that they have tracked the missing children Milivoj had hired them to find to Wolf’s Run, a dangerous area frequented by werewolves, but dared go no further. Milivoj, it seems, has paid them using funds intended to support the orphanage.

Claudia, who has been managing the orphanage for 35 years, is not popular among the children, who whisper unkind nicknames behind her back. Despite her strict demeanour, she is focused on their survival.

She explains that Milivoj has fallen gravely ill four days ago, collapsing in the halls and becoming unresponsive. The party goes to Milivoj’s room to check on the boy.

Milivoj is a 15 year old young man with a gaunt, weary appearance, his frame lean and somewhat frail. His face is angular, with a sharp jawline and hollow cheeks, giving him a somewhat sunken look. His hair is dark and messy, often unkempt, and his deep-set eyes carry an expression of fatigue and sadness. His hands, rough and calloused from years of working in the graveyard, are dirt-streaked, and his clothes are simple, showing signs of wear from his work.

The grave digger now lays cold and clammy, with a weak pulse but no visible physical injuries. Sallyanne’s medical expertise reveals no clues.

Claudia denies recognizing the children described from Morgantha’s and insists she has no knowledge of letters allegedly sent to Bella and Ophelia about fostering children with them—though her tone leaves room for doubt. She mentions that Vasilli might be an accountant. She then proceeds to tell the party that the orphanage had been recently plagued by troubling events:

* Seven days prior, three children had run away, prompting Milivoj to hire the hunters.   
* Three days ago, Cedrik, an orphan, died after falling from a second-story window.   
* Cuts and bruises marked the orphans’ bodies, yet they could not recall how they received them. 

Claudia believes these incidents are connected, possibly the work of a malevolent spirit haunting the orphanage.

She shows the party books she has been consulting for answers and points out strange symbols etched into the wooden frames of the orphans’ beds. Almost every bed bears the same ominous mark.

The party delves deeper into the mysteries surrounding the orphanage. They discover that the strange symbol etched into the children's beds is infernal writing, a recent addition to the furniture. Sallyanne senses a demonic presence emanating from Milivoj’s room, heightening the tension. The group learns that the Abbot from the Abbey of St. Markovia might be a skilled cleric who could help with their predicament.

To cover more ground, the group splits up.

Teela speaks with the children, uncovering unsettling details. Many admit to having nightmares about falling, and she learns that Fanya, an older girl, often helps Claudia care for the younger ones. Teela also meets Tessa, Cedrik’s best friend and the object of his unspoken affection. Tessa reveals that Cedrik shares a room with Mark, Stephen, and Anton—the boys who have recently "run away."

Tessa mentions another boy, Felix, who is avoided by the other orphans for being quiet and strange. Felix arrived at the orphanage two months ago after his parents were killed by werewolves. Tessa recounts an incident where Felix argued with Cedrik and, in retaliation, Cedrik stole a locket from him. Unfortunately, Teela’s intense questioning methods leave most of the children terrified by the end of her inquiries.

Tian encounters Diane, a cheerful and friendly orphan girl. She tells him that Claudia punishes misbehaving children with extra chores and shares stories about her friend Arabelle, who does not live at the orphanage. Arabelle, described as having dark curly hair, blue eyes, and darker skin, is a Vistana. Claudia has forbidden her from visiting the orphanage, as Vistani are not allowed within the city.

In Milivoj’s room, Tian finds a letter signed by Marietta, possibly Milivoj’s mother, stating, *“I cannot take care of him. I leave him in your care.”* Adjacent to Milivoj’s room, he discovers an uninhabited space filled with dust and cobwebs, left undisturbed for some time.

Sallyanne attempts to rest to change her spells but is disturbed by the same eerie presence and later by the frightened cries of the children, spooked by Teela’s interrogations.

The group reconvenes when Claudia informs them of a visitor: Ernst Larnak, the pompous butler of Lady Wachter.

Ernst Larnak is a wiry, middle-aged man with sharp, angular features that give him an air of precision and cunning. His slicked-back, greying hair adds to his polished and slightly severe appearance, while his thin, well-groomed moustache seems meticulously maintained. Dressed in formal but slightly outdated attire, his tailored coat and polished boots reflect an old-world elegance. His posture is impeccable, and he carries himself with an air of superiority, as though fully aware of his own importance. Ernst’s piercing eyes and tight-lipped expressions often seem to weigh and judge those around him, embodying his role as the trusted servant and emissary of Lady Wachter.

Ernst conveys that Lady Wachter invites the party to dinner the following evening, and they agree to attend.

Searching Claudia’s room, they find two books: *Beyond the Morninglord’s Sight* and *Toxic Parenting.* In the former, they decipher one infernal word: *“darkness.”*

Noticing that a knife is missing from the kitchen, the party heads to the attic. There, they find Felix playing with the missing knife, muttering disturbing phrases about watching people bleed. As Felix’s behavior becomes more erratic, he attacks, and the group realizes he is possessed by a shadow demon.

During the battle, the demon abandons Felix’s body, clinging to the ceiling. Tian finds the locket that Cedrik had stolen from Felix, which seems to draw the demon's focus. When Teela attempts to destroy the locket, the demon possesses her instead, using her body to knock Tian unconscious.

Sallyanne, using her aasimar abilities, saves Tian from certain death. Together, the party manages to smash the locket, banishing the demon back to the Nine Hells.

When Felix regains consciousness, he tearfully confesses the horrors the demon forced him to commit while it controlled him:

* He carved the infernal writing into the children's beds, tearing off his fingernails in the process.  
* He whispered dark, unsettling things to the sleeping orphans, giving them nightmares.  
* The demon compelled him to place the cursed locket on Milivoj’s chest.  
* After Cedrik stole the locket, the demon likely forced Felix to push Cedrik out of the window.

Felix, now catatonic, repeatedly mumbles, “Make it go away. Make me forget.”

The locket, it turns out, was given to Felix by Milivoj, who hoped it would comfort the boy after his parents’ deaths. Milivoj likely had no knowledge of its cursed nature. Upon checking on Milivoj, the group notes that his pulse has quickened, and his body temperature has risen—a hopeful sign of recovery.

Claudia expresses her gratitude to the party and offers them a place to stay at the orphanage should they ever need it.

After things calm down at the orphanage, the party has a brief conversation with Diane on their way out. She tells them that Arabelle confided in her, revealing that she has been followed by a man wearing a straw hat, a long coat, and carrying a bottle.

The group heads to the Beast’s Rose, a clothing shop, where they meet the owners, Lottie and Gilli. Gilli, a tall, bald man with a bushy beard, is married to Lottie, who is clearly out of his league. Though the party doesn’t purchase anything, they promise to return the next day to buy Tian some new clothes, as he is covered in blood. Gilli mentions the Third Eye apothecary, run by Anya, though he warns that its prices are steep. He also speaks of Jenny, a wise woman selling herbs and potions from her house.

On the way to the inn, the party overhears a conversation about the reformation camps, where a man named Joe was sent, only to return “crazy.” They also learn that Izek Strazni, the captain of the guards, is the head torturer there.

As they walk, Sallyanne recalls the encounter with the smoke demon, realizing it is a Maurezi, a type of smoke demon similar to ghouls. These demons consume flesh and absorb memories and experiences. The demon had been trying to consume Milivoj’s soul and was on the brink of succeeding. Had it succeeded, Milivoj would have become a permanent host for the demon.

When they arrive at the inn, the party reunites with Ireena and speaks with Urwin. He expresses genuine care for the children at the orphanage, sending them toys and supplies when he can. He also speaks highly of Claudia Belasco, believing her to be a capable woman. 

Ireena has stayed at the inn to try to gather more information by chatting with Urwin and Dannika and also to dye her hair brown, so she won’t be as easily recognized. She shares her findings:

* The Mad Mage of Mt. Baratok has been seen near Lake Zarovich, casting lightning at the lake.  
* Attacking the guards of Vallaki could result in execution.  
* Lady Wachter is a powerful and dangerous figure.  
* The Vistani are banned from the city, as the burgomaster suspects them of being in league with Strahd.  
* A Vistani camp has been set up to the west of the city, and the Vistani there have been restless, searching for something in the woods.  
* A man in a straw hat and long coat was seen around the time Arabelle disappeared.  
* The flamboyant circus performer, Rictavio, has been staying at the inn for some time.  
* The reformation camps are rumored to be places where people are forced to behave through harsh methods.

Meanwhile, Teela sits outside, conversing with ravens, and learns that they are spying on the people of the city. The ravens cannot reveal the name of the person they are working for, but it is clear that it is someone powerful.

Inside, Sallyanne and Ireena are approached by Nicolaj and Carl Wachter, the sons of Lady Wachter.

Nicolaj and Carl Wachter are the sons of Lady Wachter, and they share a somewhat similar appearance, though their personalities and demeanors set them apart.

Nicolaj is a tall, somewhat broad-shouldered man, likely in his mid to late twenties. He carries himself with a lazy swagger, often giving the impression that he is more interested in having fun than in any serious matters. His features are sharp, with a slightly angular face, and he has short, dark hair that he keeps neatly combed. His eyes, though often half-lidded in a relaxed manner, hold a certain arrogance. Nicolaj tends to dress in fine but unremarkable clothing, likely chosen for comfort and ease rather than fashion.

Carl is slightly younger, around twenty-four years old, with a leaner frame. He’s not as tall as Nicolaj but has a wiry strength to him. Carl has similarly dark hair, though his is a bit messier, and he often wears a mischievous grin. His features are less refined, with a more youthful appearance than his older brother. While Nicolaj seems to exude confidence effortlessly, Carl's demeanour often shows a certain restlessness or anxiety, particularly when he's not in the company of his brother. Like Nicolaj, he dresses in casual, simple attire that doesn't draw attention, but it’s clear they come from wealth.

Both brothers seem somewhat spoiled, with a playful, carefree attitude that contrasts sharply with the more serious figures around them.

The two brothers seem more interested in partying than politics and invite Sallyanne and Ireena to join them for a game of truth or dare. Through the game, the group learns the following:

* Lady Wachter had been friends with Ireena’s late father.  
* Nicolaj and Carl narrowly avoided arrest last week, only spared when the guards learned their names.  
* They are afraid of the guard captain, Izek Strazni.  
* They despise the burgomaster.  
* When Ireena asks about their sister, Carl breaks down, saying she was *“the best sister ever.”*

As the night wears on, the party prepares for bed. Before sleeping, Sallyanne decides to turn into a cat and sneak over to the burgomaster’s house. In the attic, she spots a flickering candlelight and approaches a window to get a better view. Inside one of the attic rooms, a boy with greasy dark hair kneels on the floor, reading a book and tracing intricate arcane runes. The arcane circle appears to be for teleportation or transmutation. Guarding him are six skeletal zombie cats.

One of the cats notices Sallyanne in her feline form and bangs against the window. Startled, Sallyanne quickly flees but not before spotting a second room in the attic, filled with dust and old furniture draped in white sheets, resembling ghosts.

The next morning, Ireena meets with Sallyanne and Tian, her expression grave. She shows them a letter Teela left behind, explaining that she had been invited by Strahd for a conversation and decided to confront him alone. Alongside the letter, Teela left three bottles of fire whisky. The party is left to wonder what will come of Teela’s dangerous decision. Alarmed, Sallyanne and Tian search Teela and Ireena’s room but find nothing unusual.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Three days ago, in Barovia’s Eastern Forest* 

Ziva Yamamoto wakes up in the cold forest, surrounded by swirling mists. Ziva is a 24-year-old human woman of striking presence, tall and lean with an air of elegance and practised grace. Her long, jet-black hair flows down to her waist, styled in a polished half-up top knot secured with a flame-shaped pin. Her eyes are particularly interesting: her left eye is pitch black, giving it an almost pupil-less, abyssal quality, while her right eye gleams with an unnatural amber-gold hue.

She wears a layered red ensemble adorned with black and gold trimmings that looks like a uniform. Beneath the layered fabric, the faint sound of clinking armour hints at hidden protection. The only visible weapon she carries is a sleek and elegant hand crossbow engraved with her initials. Her left hand bears a small, practical hand shield.

Intriguing tattoos mark the backs of her hands: a rising sun on the right, the holy symbol of Lathander and an ominous moon on the left, each seeming to complement her enigmatic aura. Ziva moves with a practised poise, her every motion deliberate, as though honed over years of discipline.

Ziva wakes up in the woods to a startling realization—all her gear is gone. Only the items she had on her when she fell asleep remain. Disoriented, she tries to piece together what happened, wondering if she had been robbed in the night. As she surveys her surroundings, distant shouting cuts through the stillness of the forest.

Drawn by the voice, Ziva makes her way through the trees and encounters Gavin, an imposing human man who seems just as perplexed as she is. After exchanging introductions, Gavin explains that his equipment has also vanished without a trace. Realizing they share the same predicament, the two agree to travel together to uncover the culprit behind their missing belongings.

Their search leads them to a clearing where a regal figure sits on a tree stump, the natural wood shaped eerily like a throne. The man exudes an aura of power and authority, his presence commanding immediate attention. He introduces himself as Lord Strahd von Zarovich, ruler of these lands. Ziva and Gavin offer polite introductions in return, wary but respectful.

Before they can respond further, Strahd extends a hand, and tendrils of darkness lash out into the surrounding woods. The ravens perched on nearby branches drop lifelessly to the ground. Strahd offers an almost casual apology, explaining he does not appreciate being spied on. He then turns his full attention to the pair, welcoming them to his domain and expressing his desire to test their abilities. He hints at his curiosity about Gavin’s strength and Ziva’s investigative skills. Ziva smiles carefully, noting that she never mentioned her profession to him. It’s clear this man is no ordinary noble, and every interaction with him must be handled with the utmost caution.

Accepting his challenge, Ziva and Gavin are suddenly plunged into a vision of Strahd’s creation. The world shifts around them, and though they know it’s an illusion, everything feels unsettlingly real. They find themselves tasked with solving a string of brutal murders and confronting the monstrous entity responsible. Through teamwork and resourcefulness, they unravel the mystery and put the vengeful spirit to rest.

When the vision ends, they are transported back to the clearing, Strahd waiting for them with a knowing smile. His satisfaction is evident as he commends their talents and once again welcomes them to Barovia. Before either can respond, he vanishes into a swirling mist.

Left to their own devices, Ziva and Gavin decide to search for a settlement where they can rest and regroup. As they wander through the dense, swirling mists, they stumble upon a gothic mansion deep in the woods, drawn by the sound of sobbing children.

Approaching cautiously, they meet two young siblings, Rose and Thornbolt (Thorn) Durst, crying on the steps of the house. The children beg Ziva and Gavin for help, claiming there is a monster inside their home. Moved by the children’s distress, the duo agrees to investigate.

Inside, the house feels eerily silent, its stillness unnerving. Despite their calls, no one responds. The air carries a faint chill, and the only living creature they encounter is a starving dog that begins to follow them. Naming him Lancelot, they take him along as they continue their exploration.

Curiously, though Rose and Thorn appeared normal outside, the interior of the house is anything but. The once-grand manor is marked by decay, its shabby furniture and dust-laden surfaces suggesting no one has lived there for centuries. The incongruity leaves Ziva and Gavin uneasy, but they press on, determined to uncover the truth.

As Ziva and Gavin delve deeper into the mansion, they begin piecing together its dark history. The house belonged to Gustav and Elisabeta Durst, aristocrats tied to the court of Strahd von Zarovich. What begins as a faint trail of clues soon leads them to shocking revelations about the family’s sordid past.

In Gustav’s office, they discover a hidden alcove. Within it lies an ancient skeleton clad in armor, slumped against a chest. Examining the scene, they deduce that the skeleton is relatively recent compared to the rest of the house, suggesting the remains are likely those of a would-be thief. Opening the chest, they uncover a trove of items: several spell scrolls, a collection of potions, the deed to the house, and another to a windmill—now known as the infamous Old Bonegrinder Mill. Alongside these documents lies Gustav’s signed will.

Amid the artifacts, they also find a bundle of letters, each shedding more light on the Durst family’s grim story. Ziva reads them carefully before tucking them away for safekeeping, including the deeds to the house and the windmill.

One letter, addressed to Gustav from Strahd himself, is particularly damning:

*“My most pathetic servant,*

    *I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the ones who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but worms writhing in my earth.*  
   *You say that you are cursed, your fortunes spent. You abandoned love for madness, took solace in the bosom of another woman, and sired a bastard son. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.*

*Your dread lord and master,*  
*Strahd von Zarovich”*

Another letter, penned by Elisabeta, unveils her own sinister machinations:

*“My Dear Mrs. Petrovna,*

    *I must start by congratulating you on your marriage with the Stranzi. Many scorn your decision, given their lack of status and nobility, but they have proven valuable allies in our endeavors, and I support your choice.*  
    *Your advice on dealing with the unwanted fiend in my home has been most helpful. Tonight's ceremony will proceed as planned when the moon is at its highest peak—without, of course, the attendance of Mr. Durst. I agree with your sentiment that such an innocent sacrifice may yield better results. Although, "innocent" is not quite the term I would use.*

*My Thanks,*  
*Mrs. Elisabeta Durst”*

As they press on, the final pieces of the puzzle fall into place. Ziva and Gavin uncover the horrifying truth: Gustav and Elisabeta were deeply entrenched in a cult devoted to dark rituals. Obsessed with power and immortality, they kidnapped and tortured countless victims to fuel their ambitions.

However, the family’s depravity did not end there. Sickened by Elisabeta’s growing madness, Gustav sought comfort in the arms of Margaret, the family maid. From this affair, he fathered a son, naming him Walter. Yet even this secret could not escape Elisabeta’s twisted schemes, leaving Ziva and Gavin to wonder how far the Dursts’ cruelty extended—and what remains hidden within the house’s cursed walls.

Elisabeta’s descent into madness reaches its peak when she has Margaret killed, furious over her husband’s betrayal. Worse still, she plans to sacrifice Walter, the child born of Gustav’s affair, in a twisted bid to further her dark ambitions.

Overcome with guilt and despair, Gustav, already rejected by Strahd and unable to endure the atrocities he and his wife have committed, takes his own life. Ziva and Gavin discover his skeletal remains hanging in the house, clutching a final letter addressed to his children.

The note reads:

*“My Beloved Children,*

    *I wish I could do what all fathers do and tell you that monsters aren’t real. But it wouldn’t be true.*   
    *Life can create things of exquisite beauty. But it can also twist them into hideous beings. Selfish. Violent. Grotesque. Monstrous. It hurts me to say that your mother has turned into one such monster, inside and out. And I’m afraid the disease that afflicted her mind has taken hold of me as well. It sickens me to think what we’ve put you through.*  
    *There is no excuse. I only ask of you, though I know I do not have the right to do so, to try and forgive us. I despise what your mother has become, but I love and pity her all the same.*  
   *Rose, I wish I could see you blossom into a strong, beautiful woman. Thorn, Walter, I wish I could be there for you. But I can’t. This is the only way.*

*Goodbye.”*

Further exploration leads Ziva and Gavin to Elisabeta’s room, where her twisted spirit lingers, now a wraith steeped in malice and bound to the house by her dark deeds. Her spectral form sneers at them, accusing Ziva of hypocrisy. Elisabeta points to the tattoo of a sinister moon on Ziva’s left hand and remarks that Ziva, too, is touched by the same dark entity she and Gustav once sought to summon. Despite the spirit's venom, Ziva and Gavin waste no time confronting her. In a heated battle, they banish her malevolent essence and free the house from her oppressive presence.

The grim discoveries continue as they learn the couple’s children, Rose and Thorn, were often locked in their rooms to prevent them from interfering with the cult’s rituals. In a heartbreaking moment, Ziva and Gavin find the skeletal remains of the siblings, still embracing in death. The children, it seems, succumbed to starvation, forgotten and abandoned by their parents.

At this moment, the ghosts of Rose and Thorn—the same spirits Ziva and Gavin encountered outside the house—materialize in the room, confused and frightened. Gently, Ziva explains the truth to them: they have died, and it is time for them to move on. The revelation brings a brief moment of anguish as the siblings struggle to comprehend their fate. A moment of spiritual unrest sees the spirits briefly possess Ziva and Gavin before they regain control and calm the children.

With understanding finally dawning, Rose and Thorn express their readiness to move on. But before departing, they plead with Ziva and Gavin to save their baby brother, Walter. The house’s corruption has twisted his spirit, leaving him bound in darkness.

Fueled by righteous anger at the horrors inflicted by the Dursts, Ziva vows to cleanse the house of its evil once and for all. She and Gavin piece together the grim history of the cult, the suffering it wrought, and the corruption that continues to fester. Determined to end it, the duo steel themselves and descend deeper into the mansion, heading for the crypts in the basement. There, they prepare to face whatever darkness remains.

They stumble upon a reliquary, its shadowy recesses filled with macabre relics of the Durst family’s twisted past. Each item radiates an eerie aura, hinting at the horrors that transpired in this house. Among the grim collection, they find:

* A dagger carved from human bone.  
* A weathered Tarroka deck, so damaged that some cards are unreadable, rendering it useless.  
* A hag’s severed finger.  
* A bloodstained wooden sun.  
* A broken silvered bolt.  
* A jar filled with severed raven talons soaking in wine.  
* A crown of black vines.  
* A desiccated frog tied to a stick, eerily reminiscent of a wand of polymorph.  
* A cracked egg containing the skeletal remains of a deformed infant dragon.  
* A large, pure white feather.  
* A small wooden coffer holding a dire wolf’s withered tongue.  
* A chunk of amber resin.  
* A dagger with a bat’s skull embedded in the pommel.

As they delve deeper into the basement, the true horror of the Dursts’ depravity becomes evident. They uncover dungeons lined with cells, places where kidnapped victims were imprisoned. Torture chambers reveal cruel devices designed to break both body and spirit, while bloodstained altars stand as monuments to the cult’s horrifying rituals. The air hangs heavy with malevolence, whispering of the countless lives sacrificed in the Dursts’ desperate pursuit of power and immortality.

In the largest chamber, a sinister altar stands at its center. As Ziva and Gavin approach, an oppressive chanting begins to rise, echoing from unseen voices. The sound swells, filling the room with an ominous refrain. Suddenly, thirteen dark apparitions materialize on the ledges overlooking the space. Cloaked in black robes and holding torches whose flames devour light rather than emit it, the figures seem faceless—mere voids where features should be.

*“One must die\!”* they chant in unison, their voices hollow and relentless. *“One must die\! One must die\!”*

Understanding that the apparitions demand a sacrifice, Ziva attempts to abjure them, her magic flaring in defiance. But the apparitions remain unaffected, impervious to her spells or attacks. Their chant grows louder, pressing down on the duo as they encircle them.

Desperation takes hold. Gavin, grim-faced and resolute, makes a terrible choice. Despite Ziva’s vehement protests, he sacrifices Lancelot, the loyal dog that had followed them throughout the house. The air becomes deathly still as the apparitions vanish, their grim demand fulfilled.

Yet peace does not follow. The floor trembles as an abomination barrels into the room—a writhing mass of human remains, fused together into a grotesque mound of flesh and bone. The monster attacks with feral rage, forcing Ziva and Gavin to fight for their lives. After a harrowing battle, the creature collapses. As its grotesque form disintegrates, it reveals the tiny spirit of an infant—baby Walter.

Ziva and Gavin realize this is the child Elisabeta sacrificed on the altar in her dark quest for immortality. The baby’s spirit, freed from the oppressive forces binding it to the house, lingers for a moment before dissolving into the ether, finally at peace.

Emerging from the house, Ziva wordlessly sets it ablaze, her expression a mask of grim determination. The flames consume the building, reducing it—and the horrors within—to ash.

Turning to Gavin, Ziva’s voice is cold and final. She declares that their journey together ends here. Gavin’s willingness to make a sacrifice on the altar of such a vile cult, even to save their lives, is a line she cannot forgive. Without another word, she bids him good luck and walks into the swirling mists, leaving him behind.

After hours of walking, Ziva arrives at the dreary Village of Barovia. The oppressive atmosphere clings to her like a second skin. She trades some of the jewelry and items scavenged from the Durst house for sturdier armor and a shield, knowing that the challenges of this land will require her to be better prepared.

Seeking respite, she spends the night at the Blood on the Vine Inn. The innkeeper, in hushed tones, mentions a group of *“outsiders”* who passed through the village a few days ago and made their way to Vallaki. The term *“outsiders”* strikes her as strange, further amplifying the uneasy tension she feels about the village and its people. Determined to uncover more, Ziva decides to track these adventurers down in Vallaki.

Her journey takes her to Tser’s Pool, where she encounters a camp of Vistani—a stark contrast to the grim demeanor of the Barovians. The Vistani welcome her warmly, their camp alive with laughter and music. Curious about this unfamiliar land, Ziva asks about Barovia and its history. The Vistani share snippets of its dark past, tales of their people, and the ever-present shadow of Strahd von Zarovich. Sensing her intrigue, they suggest she seek a reading from Madame Eva, their revered seer.

In Madame Eva’s tent, Ziva is met with a cryptic prophecy. The elder woman gazes into the cards and speaks in a voice layered with mystery:

*“Curious… You were to be dead. Torn forcefully from the tapestry of fate, you are now a contingency. An anomaly. Your thread is strong and weak, frayed and knotted, split and tied, broken and remade.*  
*A pawn set upon a chessboard where only kings remain.*  
*What if?... Yes. Listen. The depths are cold, and the child is on edge. Intertwine with one another. Yes, perhaps two broken knots can make a thread.*  
*You do not understand—yet. Your mind is elsewhere. You seek another. It is best to avoid the old. The mother of the Ancient is best not approached.”*

As Madame Eva finishes, she clasps Ziva’s hand, and vivid visions flood Ziva’s mind. She sees fleeting images of three adventurers escorting a red-haired woman toward a city, their choices and deeds passing in flashes. The final image lingers: a young man, Milivoj, writhing in torment, plagued by a demonic influence. The searing intensity of the vision leaves Ziva shaken but resolute.

Driven by curiosity and concern, Ziva thanks Madame Eva and departs without rest, determined to reach Vallaki as quickly as possible. The visions of Milivoj haunt her, and she feels an unshakable pull to uncover the nature of his torment. Perhaps the boy holds answers not only to his plight but to the mysteries surrounding herself as well.

At dawn, she finally reaches Vallaki, weary but resolute. After being briefed on the city’s rigid rules, she is granted entry. A few quick inquiries lead her to the Blue Water Inn, where she learns the group of adventurers and their red-haired companion are staying. Without hesitation, Ziva sets out to meet them, her heart heavy with questions and a sense of urgency driving her every step.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Returning downstairs, Sally and Tian notice Ireena speaking with a stranger. The woman introduces herself as Ziva Yamamoto, an outsider like them who arrived in Barovia just three days prior. She claims to have learned of their deeds from a vision shared to her by Madame Eva two days before. Upon seeing the demon’s influence on Milivoj, she hurried to Vallaki to meet with the party and help out however she can. What Ziva leaves out from her introduction is that she herself has a vested interest in demons and their influence over people. Though she is welcomed into the group, there’s an air of suspicion—her sudden appearance so soon after Teela’s departure is unsettling.

Urwin Martikov approaches with concern. He assures them that he’ll spread word about Teela’s disappearance and promises to alert others to keep an eye out for her. He also expresses unease, explaining that neither Strahd nor his agents should have been able to bypass the protections on the inn and the city to deliver such a letter. Urwin then turns his attention to Boyd, a local fisherman and the inn’s fish supplier. Boyd shares troubling news: Lake Zarovich’s fish stocks have dried up, leaving him with little to deliver.

The party decides to explore the town and make some purchases. Their first stop is the bookstore, run by the elderly Yonvitch and his son Sven. The shop’s shelves are disappointingly bare, with most valuable tomes “donated” to the burgomaster’s personal collection. However, a closer search yields some old history books. Yon explains that the merchant responsible for trading books with the Vistani mysteriously stopped visiting months ago, leaving the shop to function mainly as a printing press for festival flyers.

Ziva buys some books from the shop: “A short history of Barovia”, “The Fall of Berez” and “Van Richten’s guide to Lycanthropy”

**\*\*Book: A Brief History of Barovia\*\***

History: Prior to the introduction of the true and blessed faith of the Morninglord to the Barovian valley, the locals worshiped three Fey creatures that controlled the weather, earth and animals. Barovia was once populated by these groups known now as The Forest People, or Cerauneans, a loose collection of nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers that practiced only incidental agriculture, but were known to command powerful elemental forces. They called the valley Ceraunos. 

A group of settlers later called the Delmor, the Dusk Elves, invaded the valley and established several small agricultural and industrial outposts, pushing the native Cerauneans to the edges of the valley with steel and cavalry. Shortly after, the kingdom they had come from fractured due to civil war and lost the taste for expansion, largely leaving outposts like the Ceraunos valley to fend for themselves. Many left the valley, but some stayed behind in what were now the loosely confederated city states of what they called the Delmor Valley; Vallaki, Berez, and Krezk. The druidic tribes and their so-called goddesses took back much of the land.

Nearly a hundred years later the armies of Barov Von Zarovich, led by his son Strahd, swept through the Delmor valley, meeting little resistance from the confederacy that had largely relied on its isolation for defense this last century. The druidic tribes of The Forest People divided themselves, as some wished to ally with Strahd, defend their land against him, or leave the valley entirely. 

Aided by a sect of the druids, Strahd's conquest was successful. He was named governor of the valley, which he named Barovia after his father. He began construction on a great castle with the assistance of his court wizard and chief architect, Kazahn, and introduced Morninglord worship to the valley. 

Fifteen years on, civil unrest caused Barov to flee with his wife Ravenovia and youngest son Sergei to the colony of Barovia, where his son had spent the intervening years essentially in exile while he put down incessant rebellions. Queen Ravenovia did not survive the journey.

**\*\*Book: The Fall of Berez\*\***

Berez was once one of the biggest and prosperous settlements in Barovia. The people of Berez gave some grave offense to the Strahd, in response to which he opened the earth up and swallowed the city. Most of the story surrounds points of views and snippets from members of the Ulrich family. The book speculates on what the offense may have been, proposing several theories from rampant perversion and incestuous affairs to harboring a thief of some great treasure.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**\*\*Book: Van Richten's guide to Lycanthropy\*\***

There are essentially three types of Lycanthrope: Inherited, Infected, and Maledictive (cursed).

An inherited or 'True' Lycanthrope is a genetic lycanthrope. They are Lycans from the day they are born, but don't have the ability to Shift until they hit puberty. They have a short period of uncontrolled shapeshifting after which they are forever in control of their shift--they never have to worry about a 'trigger' causing them to shift unwillingly.

An Infected lycanthrope is someone who has been bitten by a True Lycanthrope or another Infected. An Infected Lycan can never control their shift, and are unaware of what they do while shifted. Some rare cases show that individuals have the capacity to control their shift.

A Maledictive Lycanthrope is hard to quantify in terms of their capabilities, but is simply an individual who was Cursed with lycanthropy by means other than birth or bite

Werewolves are those inflicted with the curse of lycanthropy.

When subjected to certain conditions, in particular the light of a full moon, a werewolf will involuntarily transform into its hybrid form, usually being overtaken with an insatiable bloodlust that does not subside until dawn.

There is some evidence that a small number of lycanthropes have the ability to transform at will, though their means of doing so remain a mystery.

Wereravens are those inflicted with the curse of lycanthropy.

Wereravens are rumored to be amongst the most intelligent lycanthropes in the Realms. These werebeasts had three forms: human form, giant raven form, and hybrid form. Only natural wereravens could assume all three forms, whereas infected wereravens could only assume the human form and one of the other two.

When transforming into one of the non-human forms, the being grew feathers from its skin, which slowly turned into large wings (allowing them to be proficient in aerial combat). In this process, the arms would stretch to accommodate the wings, whilst the mouth transformed into a beak.

Anti-lycanthrope tactics: Keep them at range and away from cover. Silvered arrows, bolts and nets in combination with magical methods of slowing and immobilizing them can make fighting lone werewolves trivial. If ambushed by a pack of werewolves, a fighting retreat is always the best option, particularly if you aren’t armed with silvered weapons. Even a single bite can lead to an incurable infection of lycanthropy.

Lycanthropes of all types are so resistant to conventional weaponry that it is worthless to even try. If all you have is an ordinary spear, just retreat.

Belladonna Root is rumored as a possible cure if taken before the first transformation. Belladonna root is exceptionally poisonous, and is recommended only as a last resort. In the one instance the author attempted to apply it, it resulted in the victim’s death.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, they visit the Dusklight Supply Shop to purchase spell components. Here, Ireena comes across an old rapier, tarnished with age but at least fifty years old. As she picks it up, she instinctively executes flawless fencing forms. The skill feels familiar to her, though she cannot explain how she knows it. Troubled yet reserved, she sets the rapier aside. The party also notes the town’s steep prices, as every shopkeeper reiterates the same line: “This is the normal price.”

The group then heads to Thindul’s Armaments, the town’s blacksmith, run by Piersym Rawley, an elderly, blind ex-guard. Piersym, sympathetic to their dislike of the burgomaster, shares insights about Vallaki’s governance. He explains that the festivals were Vargas’s idea and that not all guards are cruel, though they are all terrified of Izek Strazni, whose brutal methods keep order in the city. When Ireena expresses interest in acquiring armour and a sword, Piersym agrees to craft them for a steep price. After Ziva asks Piersym how much he believes his eyesight will cost, she manages to convince him to craft the armour and weapons in exchange for his sight. Piersym, sceptical at first, reluctantly agrees, fully believing that his eyesight cannot be cured. To everyone’s surprise, Ziva channels divine light to cast *Lesser Restoration* and cure Piersym’s blindness, but asks him to keep her involvement a secret.

As they leave the armoury, Ziva explains to the party that she is able to channel divine magic because she is a cleric of Lathander, the Morninglord, the god of dawn, rebirth, and renewal. However, she clarifies that while she channels divine magic through her connection to the Morninglord, she is not part of his formal clergy.

Instead, Ziva works as a private investigator, dedicating her skills to solving cases that others might consider unsolvable or too insignificant to pursue. Her passion lies in unravelling mysteries and bringing hidden truths to light. Naturally inquisitive, her sharp mind and innate nosiness make her well-suited for her line of work—delving into puzzles with determination and uncovering the answers no one else thinks to seek.

The party’s next stop is Old Jenny’s house. Jenny is an eccentric and slightly unhinged old herbalist who runs her tiny shop out of her own house, the “shop” consisting of a mismatched collection of rickety shelves and jars filled with strange liquids and dried plant matter. Her appearance matches the disarray of her shop—wild, wiry gray hair that seems to have a mind of its own, sticking out at odd angles as though she’s constantly caught in a windstorm. She has small beady eyes that seem to always question something and a crooked nose. She wears a patchwork dress of mismatched fabrics, pockets bulging with vials, herbs, and small trinkets. When the party meets her, she is in the process of skinning a cat for ingredients to her potions.

Jenny sells them a healer’s kit, calming tea, and a peculiar Vistana remedy she refers to as “coochy” — a psychedelic blend of mushrooms with an almost otherworldly effect. She also barters with Ziva, trading her Bag of Holding for the deed to the Old Bonegrinder Mill, which Ziva had found in the Durst family home. When Jenny hesitates, remarking that the mill is overrun by hags, Ziva calmly reassures her that the place has been cleared out recently. However, the fact that Jenny seems to know the mill’s dark history—down to its exact inhabitants—only deepens her enigmatic presence.

Despite her odd demeanour, Jenny proves helpful, and the group departs with their new items.

Their errands are interrupted by the arrival of seven guards led by Izek Strazni. A towering, monstrous figure, Izek commands attention with his grotesque, demon-like right hand, black and feathered with sharp talons. His immense greataxe, as tall as a man, rests ominously on his back. Izek delivers a message from the burgomaster, promising the party 700 gold pieces if they can produce results in their investigation into Lady Wachter. However, his tone turns threatening as he warns them not to criticise the current state of Vallaki.

As the guards prepare to leave, Izek gives Tian—still wrapped in bandages—a second glance, his sneer dripping with disdain.

The party heads to Lake Zarovich, hoping to find the rumoured wizard said to be shooting lightning at the lake.

On the way, Ireena expresses her frustration, feeling as though she is being babysat and wanting to contribute more actively to the group's efforts.

When they reach the lake, its crystal-clear surface and frigid waters greet them. Three row boats are docked at the shore. In the middle of the lake, they spot a man in a rowboat struggling to stand, clutching a sack that appears to contain a small child.

Sallyanne immediately dives into the water, shapeshifting into a giant squid. Tian and Ziva jump into another boat and row toward the man, shouting for him to stop, while Ireena takes the third boat. The man, panicked, throws the sack into the water, where it begins to sink. He then attempts to row away, though not very successfully.

Sallyanne retrieves the sack and brings it to Tian and Ziva's boat. They untie it, revealing an unconscious young girl with black hair. As Sallyanne pursues the man, Tian and Ziva manage to resuscitate the girl, who they learn is Arabelle, Diane’s Vistani friend.

Sallyanne catches up with the man, and the party regroups for an impromptu interrogation. The man is dressed in shabby clothes, wearing a straw hat, and introduces himself as Bluto, the drunk fisherman who had recently boasted about finding a "lucky charm" to improve his fishing.

Bluto reveals his disturbing belief that drowning Arabelle would bring him luck while fishing. He admits to kidnapping her four or five days ago, keeping her in his house, and even buying her a Blinsky toy to quiet her screams. He justifies his actions by claiming that Vistani lives are worthless and that no one would care if one of them died.

Furious, Sallyanne intimidates Bluto, instilling in him a fear of dark, tentacled retribution before knocking him unconscious.

As they row back to shore with Bluto in tow, Arabelle, now awake, reveals she is a *rauni*—a Vistani seer—but explains that her visions come unbidden and are beyond her control. She demonstrates an uncanny awareness, noting that Ireena has seen "*the Devil*" and even recognizing Sallyanne’s true form after touching one of her tentacles.

The party debates Bluto's fate. Turning him over to the guards would likely lead to his torture, but killing him outright feels wrong. Ultimately, Ziva convinces Bluto that Sallyanne's squid form has implanted eggs in his brain that will hatch if he doesn’t reform his ways. Unsatisfied with this leniency, Arabelle places a Vistani curse on him: *"May all wine turn to water in your mouth."*

The party escorts Arabelle back to her Vistani camp, promising to check on her the next day. As they part, Arabelle shakes Ziva’s hand, and the moment their hands touch, they both see a vision of a dark, violent night, seen from the perspective of a little girl. People are screaming and running as night creatures roam their settlement. Fires erupt everywhere and the little girl looks up at a tall man holding her hand and dragging her away. The vision ends as abruptly as it began and Arabelle’s eyes widen with recognition of what just happened. She mumbles a hasty farewell to the group and starts running towards the camp. Ziva is left dumbfounded by the vision and Arabelle’s suspicious and sudden departure.

Afterward, the group heads to Lady Wachter’s house, located in the northern part of Vallaki. Preparing for the meeting, Sallyanne offers to help the group freshen up but inadvertently washes the dye out of Ireena's hair, revealing her natural colour. Along the way, they notice ravens watching them.

Upon arrival, Ernst, the butler, escorts them into the opulent yet slightly decayed mansion. The furnishings and decor hint at former grandeur but are now chipped and worn.

Lady Fiona Wachter greets them. She is a tall, stately woman in her late 50s to early 60s, with an air of imperious authority. Her silver-streaked, blonde hair is neatly styled, framing a sharp, angular face that reflects her shrewdness and pride. Her piercing grey eyes hold a calculating intensity, as if always weighing and assessing those around her. Despite her age, she carries herself with grace and poise, exuding confidence and a commanding presence.

She is typically dressed in elegant yet sombre attire, favouring black dresses with intricate embroidery or lace accents, often accompanied by subtle silver or dark jewel embellishments. Her clothing reflects her noble status while maintaining a tone of dignity and restraint. A faint aroma of old lavender and parchment lingers around her, matching the antiquated yet dignified atmosphere of her household.

Lady Wachter’s demeanour is calm and deliberate, with a voice that is smooth and measured, capable of soothing or unsettling in equal measure. Even her movements seem calculated, reinforcing the impression of a woman who is always in control—or at least appears to be.

She reveals that she was once friends with Ireena’s father, assuring Ireena that she is always welcome in her home.

As dinner commences, the party learns more about Lady Wachter. A practised politician, she speaks of giving back to the community, though her words feel rehearsed and self-serving. She openly scorns the Burgomaster, Vargas Vallakovich, whom she calls a cruel and manipulative leader hiding his tyranny behind closed doors. She recounts the brutal public executions under Vargas’s father, Vargon, noting that the only difference now is the façade of civility.

Her grievances against Vargas are deeply personal. She had tried to unite their houses by arranging a marriage between her daughter, Stella, and Vargas's son, Victor. However, Stella returned from the Vallakovich household mentally broken, reduced to a feral, catlike state. Lady Wachter believes Victor is to blame but has found no evidence to confirm this.

She shares a different perspective on Strahd, recalling a diplomatic mission to Castle Ravenloft during her youth. Strahd treated her as an honoured guest, even politely accepting her refusal to become one of his concubines. She insists he is no monster, though her recollection feels naïve or willfully blind.

Lady Wachter offers the party three ways to gain her trust:

1. Expose Vargas’s cruelty by bringing proof of his misdeeds.  
2. Discover what Victor did to Stella.  
3. Kill Izek Strazni, Vargas’s monstrous enforcer.

Before the party leaves, she takes them to see Stella. The girl is physically unharmed but mentally shattered, behaving like a wild animal. She has limited speech but still recognizes her mother. Lady Wachter pleads with the party to uncover the truth of what Victor did to her daughter, making it clear that her vendetta against Vargas has become deeply personal.

The party leaves the house, shaken by Stella’s condition. They vow to find a cure for the poor girl. As they are walking, Ziva casually mentions she has met the Devil when she arrived in Barovia.

Sally is furious with Ziva for not disclosing her prior encounter with Strahd. As soon as they leave Lady Wachter’s house, Sally confronts her, accidentally uttering Strahd’s name aloud. This nearly lands the group in trouble when guards approach, but Ziva manages to defuse the situation, convincing the guards it was an unintentional slip and offering a bribe of 100 gold pieces to avoid arrest.

Once out of sight, the party retreats to a dark alley to continue their discussion. Sally and Ziva work through their differences, with Ziva explaining that when she met him, Strahd killed the ravens present, suspecting them of being spies. While in the alley, they discover a dirty doll resembling Tian, clearly crafted by Blinsky. As they inspect it, another close call with the bribed guard arises when a spell with a verbal component is cast. Sally quickly uses **Pass Without Trace**, allowing the group to evade capture and avoid being thrown in the stocks.

Back at the inn, the party splits up. Sally retreats to her room and casts **Detect Magic**, sensing a faint magical presence coming from the next room. Ziva and Tian remain downstairs, speaking with Dannika and Urwin. Sally, in her spider form, investigates further and enters the Martikov boys’ room. Inside, she finds a large mural of flying ravens and various toys from Blinsky. Exploring further, she discovers a secret passage leading to a barn-like area filled with sleeping ravens. In a hidden chest, she finds coins, five bottles of liquid (possibly magical), and a **Bag of Tricks**.

Meanwhile, Ziva and Tian learn that Urwin recently visited the orphanage and reveals that Feelix is struggling to sleep and is experiencing difficulties. They also discover that Rictavio has not performed at the inn for three days, contrary to their arrangement. Tian presses Urwin further, finding out that while Urwin prefers Lady Wachter over the Burgomaster, he remains uncertain of her true intentions. Her sympathies for Strahd might make her an even greater threat.

Later, Sally and Ziva have a heart-to-heart conversation, during which Sally reveals her age (19) and her upbringing in the forest. She grew up in a village composed of druids and nature loving people, making friends with animals and children alike. Her happy childhood didn’t last long, however, as her people and her mother were brutally killed by a living shadow. The attack on her village scarred her emotionally and physically. She now has a black wound above her right shoulder that sometimes oozes smoke and never fully heals. 

Determined to gather more information about the Vallakoviches, Sally transforms into a cat and spies on the Burgomaster and his son, Victor. In the master bedroom, she finds Vargas reviewing documents while surrounded by two large dogs. His meek and fearful wife enters briefly but is quickly ushered out. In Victor’s quarters, she observes his frustration and hears him mumbling to himself. He kicks a skeletal cat, which reforms moments later, and hides a journal with notes beneath a false bottom in a drawer.

The next morning, the party visits the Vistani camp near the western wall of Vallaki. They are greeted by three elven guards and meet Luvash, Arabelle’s father and the leader of the clan. 

Luvash, the leader of the Vistani encampment near Vallaki, is a broad-shouldered and imposing man in his mid 40s. His dark hair is long, curly and unkempt, often tied back loosely, and his face is adorned with a well-trimmed beard that frames his sharp, expressive features. His piercing dark eyes seem to hold equal measures of cunning and intensity, reflecting his experience as both a leader and a father. Luvash dresses in rich, colourful Vistani attire, favouring deep reds and golds accented with intricate embroidery, showing both his wealth and his cultural pride.

Despite his rough demeanour, there is a protective air about him, especially when it comes to his family, but also a joyfulness and love for life. His voice is deep and commanding, but it can soften when speaking of matters close to his heart. A heavy belt at his waist carries a curved dagger and a few practical tools, hinting at his readiness for trouble. His every movement is confident, befitting a man accustomed to authority and the respect of his people.

In gratitude for saving Arabelle, the Vistani grant them the honorary title of “*giocotto*” (accepted members of the Vistani, even without Vistani blood). They are also allowed to choose a reward from the gift wagon, with the stipulation that they may touch only the item they select.

Sally casts **Detect Magic** and senses faint magic emanating from a rolled-up carpet. Excited at the possibility of acquiring a flying carpet, the group chooses it. However, when they unfurl it, a quirky construct named Piddlewick the Second tumbles out and immediately starts bonking Tian on the knees with a rod, much to the group's amusement. Luvash bursts out laughing, declaring that Piddlewick is now their problem to deal with.

Piddlewick the Second is a curious and whimsical construct, a blend of clockwork ingenuity and eerie charm. Standing about two feet tall, it resembles a patchwork humanoid puppet with exaggerated features and delicate, mechanical movements. Its body is a combination of polished wood, tarnished metal, and faded fabric, giving it a worn yet oddly endearing appearance.

The construct's head is slightly oversized, with a painted face that has faded over time, featuring a permanent mischievous smile and wide, expressive eyes that occasionally blink with a faint metallic click. Its limbs are jointed with visible gears and springs, allowing for an almost lifelike fluidity in its movements, though there's an occasional stutter or whir of its inner mechanisms.

Piddlewick wears a tattered, colourful outfit reminiscent of a court jester, complete with a few dangling bells that faintly jingle when it moves. Its hands are small and precise, capable of wielding simple objects with surprising dexterity, and it carries itself with a peculiar mix of innocence and mischief.

The party learns that Piddlewick the Second is a construct designed to entertain, built as a replacement after the original Piddlewick broke. He was created to bring laughter and joy to those around him.

The group proceeds to the main tent of the Vistani camp, where Luvash is waiting. Arabelle enters, carrying a tray of apples, and sits beside her father. Luvash expresses his gratitude for saving his daughter once more, but when Ziva mentions Arabelle cursing Bluto, Luvash grows concerned. He explains that while some Vistani possess the power to curse people, it is a gift that must be wielded with care.

Luvash shares the difficulties his people have faced in recent years, as the land has grown increasingly dangerous and erratic. He worries about a search party led by his brother, Arrigal, which ventured into the woods to search for Arabelle but has not returned.

During the conversation, Luvash warns the group about *shells*—soulless individuals left behind after Strahd drains their essence. He emphasises that death offers no true escape in Barovia, as many souls are trapped within the mists. He also recounts a clash in the woods between the Vistani and Captain Izek Strazni. Arrigal instigated the fight, but Izek fought back with terrifying strength, his demonic arm granting him unnatural power.

Luvash reveals that Arabelle's mother, Ana, died a year after Arabelle was born. At that moment, Arrigal enters the tent. 

Arrigal, a prominent member of the Vistani, is Luvash's younger brother and serves as a skilled and cunning tracker for their camp. He is a wiry man with sharp, angular features, piercing dark eyes, and a neatly trimmed beard that adds to his stern appearance. Arrigal often wears practical clothing, accented with Vistani flair, such as a sash or scarf in vibrant colours. His demeanour is serious and guarded, marked by a deep mistrust of outsiders, though he is fiercely loyal to his family and people.

Despite his often cold exterior, Arrigal demonstrates a strong protective instinct, especially toward his niece, Arabelle. His close bond with her reveals a more compassionate side, as he treats her with a kindness and warmth he seldom shows to others. Arrigal’s expertise as a scout and his deep knowledge of Barovia’s treacherous terrain make him a vital figure among the Vistani. However, his cautious and secretive nature can make him difficult to approach or fully trust.

Though wary of outsiders, his demeanour softens slightly due to the group’s rescue of Arabelle. The party observes a close bond between Arrigal and Arabelle, who seems to cherish her uncle’s company because he treats her like a child rather than a *rauni*.

Arrigal offers the party information about a secret tunnel on the northeastern edge of Vallaki that leads to an empty well, providing a way to enter the city unseen. 

He also explains that a Vistani outcast is referred to as a “*mortu”* and suggests the Vistana mentioned in Madame Eva’s vision (the one who is looking for her master) might be one of these exiles from the settlement near Krezk.

Shortly after, Arrigal asks everyone except Ziva and Luvash to leave the tent. Suspicious, Sally transforms into a spider and sneaks back in to eavesdrop. Arrigal and Luvash question Ziva about her and Arabelle’s shared vision. Ziva describes a memory of a young girl fleeing a burning village that is being attacked by night creatures and eventually being separated from a man whose description matches Luvash. This stirs a painful recollection in Luvash, who recounts the loss of his first daughter, Yvanna, under identical circumstances. Though Ziva remains sceptical, Luvash points out a unique birthmark on her neck identical to Yvanna’s.

Ziva is still unconvinced that this is more than mere coincidence, as she has no recollection of any of them. When Arrigal accuses Ziva of lying, she offers to cast *Zone of Truth* to ensure honesty. Though Arrigal refuses to step into the spell’s area, Ziva willingly subjects herself to it and reaffirms her identity. She has grown up in a village seven days north of Waterdeep. Luvash, moved, sings a lullaby that triggers another vision for Ziva—this time of a young girl dancing by a campfire under the watchful eyes of Luvash and a dark-haired woman, presumably Ana.

Though unsettled by the events that just unfolded, but unwilling to give any credit without further proof, Ziva excuses herself, leaving the two men in the tent, Luvash crying softly and being comforted by his brother. Ziva rejoins the party, sharing a summary of what happened. 

They decide to visit Kazimir, the leader of the dusk elves, for insight. At the dusk elf settlement, Sally notes that there are no female elves present.

Kazimir receives the group warily at first, but starts to share the history of Barovia after some small talk. The land was once home to nomadic tribes who worshipped three archfey known as the **Ladies Three**:

* **The Huntress**, the Mountain Fane  
* **The Weaver**, the Swamp Fane  
* **The Seeker**, the Forest Fane

These deities protected the land until Strahd arrived with his armies, bringing war and his faith in the Morninglord. Though Strahd was once mortal, he eventually discovered a place of ancient power that transformed him into what he is today.

Kazimir recounts the tragic history of his people. His sister, Patrina let herself be swayed by illusions of grandeur and wanted to join Strahd in immortal life. The dusk elves tried to persuade her not to go, but she would not be stopped, so they captured her and stoned her to death. 

In retaliation for taking what was his, Strahd slaughtered all the dusk elf women and left the men to suffer and their race to slowly die out. Kazimir, mutilated by Strahd for his defiance, now seeks redemption and believes answers lie in the **Amber Temple**, a place of dark power guarded by monstrous creatures. He warns the party they are not yet ready to face it but offers to join them when the time comes.

Kazimir also mentions the Order of the Silver Dragon, a group that once opposed Strahd but met its end at the Battle of Argynvostholt. Rumours persist of restless spirits from the Order seeking vengeance. He confirms that the ravens spying on the party are part of the Resistance, a secretive group working against Strahd.

As the group prepares to leave the camp, Arabelle shares with them that she has had another vision: *“a demonic horse with a mane and tail of fire flying through the sky.”*

The group travels to Lake Zarovich, hoping to spot the rumoured wizard, but the lake is eerily still. They glimpse a white elk that vanishes into the mist.

Next, they visit Pyesrim the blacksmith to collect Ireena’s armour, engraved with an inscription for protection. They also stop by Blinsky’s shop, where they meet Blinsky.

Gadof Blinsky is the eccentric toymaker of Vallaki, a round-faced, jolly man with an air of childlike enthusiasm. He has a rotund physique and often wears brightly coloured clothing reminiscent of a jester, complete with a tasselled hat that adds to his whimsical appearance. His wide, ever-present grin and lively eyes convey an almost infectious cheerfulness, though there is an unsettling edge to his demeanour.

Blinsky runs a cluttered toy shop filled with bizarre and macabre creations, each toy carrying an odd, dark twist. From headless dolls to eerie music boxes, his toys reflect a strange blend of humour and morbidity. Despite the peculiar nature of his work, Blinsky insists his creations are *"Is no fun, is no Blinsky\!"*—a cheerful slogan that underlines his genuine passion for his craft.

He is accompanied by his pet monkey, Piccolo, who wears a pink tutu and serves as both a companion and part of Blinsky’s quirky image. Beneath his jovial exterior, there is a sense of melancholy, as his shop sees few customers, leaving him struggling to make a living in the oppressive land of Barovia. 

He becomes ecstatic upon seeing Piddlewick, calling it the greatest invention of the famed toymaker Fritz von Berg.

Blinsky begs to study Piddlewick, offering to trade Piccolo in return. After negotiations, the party agrees to lend him the construct for two days. 

Blinsky then reveals that Captain Izek Strazni first started commissioning the Tian-like doll five or six years ago, returning once a month to check on the progress and to demand adjustments. Terrified, Blinsky fears retaliation for sharing this information.

At Blinsky’s shop, the party further questions Blinsky. They learn that Piccolo originally belonged to Rictavio, the elf they met a few days ago. Rictavio and Blinsky are friends, and the elf left Piccolo in Blinsky’s care.

Blinsky also reveals that Captain Strazni always comes alone to pick up the dolls he commissions. Strazni meticulously ensures no one else is in the shop during these visits. Additionally, Blinsky tells the party about Fritz von Berg, a famous toy maker whose final and greatest creation was Piddlewick the Second. There were rumours that Piddlewick was commissioned by a countess at Castle Ravenloft.

After leaving Blinsky’s shop, the party is asked by Ireena how they felt about the journey so far, given that they began as her bodyguards. She then surprises them by giving each of them a hand-embroidered handkerchief with a white raven on a red field. She mentions that she planned to return to the inn, believing she could gather information more effectively there.

On their way to the orphanage, the party passes a group advocating for “The Purge,” loudly proclaiming that the signs had aligned and that action would soon be taken. Guards notice the disturbance and violently suppress the group. Sally observes ravens watching the scene unfold.

At the orphanage, the party is greeted by Madame Belasco, who happily informs them that the children are improving and that repairs to the attic, with Urwin's help, are underway. She leads them to Milivoj’s room, cautioning that while he is awake, he is very weak and reluctant to speak.

In his room, Milivoj, an awkward and uneasy teenager, begrudgingly recounts how he came into possession of the cursed locket and the story of the bones’ disappearance:

* Three weeks ago, a hooded man with a gruff, raspy voice approached Milivoj in the street. The man, who smelled of alcohol and had a beard, offered to pay him for information about anything special kept at the church.  
* Milivoj, needing money for the orphanage, discovered from Yeska, the altar boy, that the church housed something magical—Saint Andral’s bones. He shared this information with the man and received 50 gold pieces and the cursed locket.  
* The man then promised Milivoj even more money if he stole the bones. Milivoj agreed and a week later, under the pretext of grave digging, snuck into the church and stole them. He delivered the bones to a cart parked near the Wachterhaus.  
* Shortly after, Milivoj began to feel weak, strange events started to plague the orphanage, and children experienced terrible nightmares. Some even ran away. Desperate, Milivoj hired hunters Soldar and Yevgeni to track the children but collapsed from exhaustion before doing more.

After distributing toys to the children, the party spot a raven. Sally casts *Speak with Animals* and converses with it. The raven, Tanicia, claims to be an “independent contractor” but reveals that most ravens work for the Martikov family. Urwin, or "*The Spymaster*" feeds the ravens and in return, they bring him information. Tanicia also tells the party that the Martikovs are part of the *Keepers of the Feather*.

The party proceeds to the cart drop-off location Milivoj mentioned, but it is no longer there. A neighbour informs them that the cart was handled by Henrik Van der Vort, the coffin maker, around the time of the theft.

At Henrik’s shop, the party splits up: Sally and Tian investigate the back while Ziva distracts Henrik at the front. Sally transforms into a spider, sneaks inside, and grapples Henrik while Ziva teleports in and opens the door for Tian. With Henrik restrained, Ziva casts *Zone of Truth*, and Henrik confesses to the following:

* A dark-skinned woman named Ludmilla coerced him into stealing the bones three weeks ago, threatening his life and paying him to use Milivoj, the gravedigger, to accomplish the task.  
* Ludmilla instructed Henrik to find the church’s source of protection and deliver the bones to her. She explicitly warned him not to go upstairs afterward.

The party secure Henrik and head upstairs, avoiding apparent traps until Tian opens the door, triggering a **Glyph of Warding**. 

Ludmilla, awoken from her sleep by the triggering of the **Glyph of Warding**, rises from her coffin. She is a strikingly beautiful woman with smooth, dark skin and sharp, elegant features. Her almond-shaped red eyes, often described as piercing or intense, seem to take in everything around her with calculated precision. She has long, sleek hair that she typically styles neatly, adding to her composed and regal appearance. Her clothing is luxurious and sophisticated, adorned in dark, rich colours like crimson, black, or deep purple, giving her an aura of both nobility and mystery. Her presence is commanding, and she carries herself with a grace that makes her unforgettable to those who meet her.

She rises from her coffin and alongside her, six other ravenous vampire spawn rise as well. She grabs the bag containing the bones and declares that her plan will move forward sooner than expected. Presumably, she was going to let the feral spawns loose on the town of Vallaki during the next festival. She swiftly and gleefully orders the spawn to feast on Vallaki.

The party realise too late that Strahd had been scrying through Henrik when the glyph activated. Henrik, horrified, whispered that Strahd is coming—and that he is angry.

Ludmilla gazes at the party, her crimson eyes gleaming with malice in the dim light. She seizes the bag of bones and issues a command to her spawn, their plan accelerating ahead of schedule. With a sinister smirk, she declares her intent to take a stroll. Shattering the windows, she leaps into the night, vanishing into the shadows.

Tian bolts from the house, catching sight of Ludmilla sprinting northward through the streets of Vallaki, her movements swift and unyielding. Meanwhile, Sally transforms into a direwolf, her instincts urging her to stay behind and protect Ziva, who stands panicked amidst six ravenous vampire spawn. The spawn, feral and maddened by hunger, scatter and rush toward the exits, driven by an insatiable need to feed.

Ziva runs toward the shattered window, jumps out and casts **Misty Step**, teleporting to the street below, her resolve solidifying as the chaos unfolds.

Ludmilla, still clutching the bag of bones, gracefully weaves through the streets, her predatory smile never faltering. The party gives chase, their urgency mounting. Tian shouts warnings to the townsfolk, urging them to call the guards and retreat indoors. The sight of an aarakocra barking orders is alien to the townspeople, but as the gravity of his words sinks in, they scatter, their fear palpable.

Tian, despite his wings not being fully healed, takes to the air, pursuing Ludmilla with determined fervor. Sally, in her direwolf form, leaps through the shattered window, landing near Ziva. She lunges at a nearby spawn, but the creatures, too fast to be cornered, disperse further into the depths of Vallaki.

Ziva mounts Sally’s back and uses Thaumaturgy to amplify her voice, her words booming across the town. She calls for Captain Strazni and the guards, imploring the citizens to seek shelter as the threat becomes evident. Panic spreads like wildfire, the town descending into chaos.

Ludmilla ascends effortlessly onto a rooftop, her vampiric strength on full display as she continues her escape to the north. Tian adjusts his flight path, determined to close the distance, while Sally, carrying Ziva, sprints at full speed below. Explosions and screams erupt throughout Vallaki, the chaos intensifying with each passing moment.

With a flourish, Ludmilla casts **Magic Missile** at Tian, forcing him to falter as she shifts course to lower rooftops. Tian pushes through the pain, maintaining his pursuit as best he can. Sally, in her direwolf form howls, vaulting over crates and obstacles with Ziva still on her back.

Rain begins to pour, drenching the town in a cold, relentless downpour. Fires from ignited houses illuminate the darkness, and the scent of smoke mingles with the cries of the terrified residents. Ludmilla revels in the chase, casting spells to hinder her pursuers, her cackle echoing in the storm.

The screams of dying people reach the group and Ziva once again starts yelling at nearby bystanders to get inside their houses. This time, people manage to overcome their panic and start moving inside their houses.

Ludmilla drops gracefully to the ground, her movements fluid and deliberate. With a flick of her wrist, she casts another spell at Tian, the arcane energy striking him and forcing him to falter. The brief distraction allows her to gain precious ground.

Behind her, Sally, burdened by the weight of Ziva on her back, struggles to maintain the speed she needs. Despite her powerful strides, the extra weight slows her progress more than she would like.

Ludmilla slips into the shadows, leaping effortlessly between two buildings. The darkness envelops her as she continues her escape, her red eyes gleaming faintly before she fires another spell at Tian, the magical barrage aimed at further slowing his pursuit. The assault forces Tian to adjust his flight, his rhythm disrupted by the relentless attacks.

Through the clamor of the city, Tian hears the rhythmic pounding of paws against cobblestones. He glances over his shoulder and catches sight of a direwolf leaping over a crate beside him, its haunting howl echoing through the chaos. For a split second, the sight startles him, but as his sharp eyes catch Ziva clinging to the direwolf's back, he quickly realizes the creature is Sally in her shapechanged form.

Ahead, Ludmilla’s cackling rings out, a sound of pure delight as she revels in the chase. She continues to dart through the streets, weaving through the darkness with supernatural grace.

Through the torrential rain, Sally, still in direwolf form and carrying Ziva, pushes forward with renewed determination. Her powerful strides and sheer will allow her to close the gap, catching up with Tian as the two pursue Ludmilla through the rain-soaked streets. Together, they begin to gain ground, their resolve unwavering despite the chaos surrounding them.

Ziva focuses her magical energy and casts **Command**, compelling Ludmilla to drop the bag of bones. The vampire’s jaw tightens as the spell takes hold, and she releases the bag, her amusement giving way to irritation. Acknowledging the party’s persistence, Ludmilla slows, her demeanor shifting to one of predatory intent.

Tian seizes the moment, activating his tattoo to enhance his strikes, his attacks precise and relentless. Ludmilla, though staggered, resists the full brunt of his assault. Sally, biting and clawing at her, supports the effort as Ziva dismounts, retrieves the bag, and casts **Dissonant Whispers** to drive Ludmilla further back. The vampire resists the psychic assault but finds herself momentarily cornered.

Ludmilla darts past Sally and Tian, her agility unmatched as she lunges for Ziva, determined to reclaim the bag. Despite their best efforts to intercept her, Ludmilla maneuvers with cunning precision. Grappling Ziva, she whispers chilling promises of Strahd’s impending arrival and attempts to wrest the bag from her grasp. Ziva, however, refuses to yield, landing an elbow to Ludmilla’s stomach in defiance.

Enraged, Ludmilla sinks her teeth into Ziva’s shoulder but fails to penetrate the armor beneath her clothing. Tian, moving swiftly, lands a series of precise blows that stun Ludmilla, rendering her immobile. As she collapses to the ground, releasing Ziva, Tian attempts to entangle her with a net but loses his grip in the chaos. Without hesitation, he dashes toward the Blue Water Inn to alert the townsfolk of the attack.

Sally lowers herself, signaling Ziva to climb back onto her back. Understanding the urgency, Ziva mounts once more, and the direwolf sprints toward the church, the bag of bones clutched tightly in Ziva’s hands.

As they race through the rain-soaked streets, Ziva and Sally witness Piersym Rawley, the elderly blacksmith whom Ziva had once healed, stepping out of his shop to defend the townsfolk. He bravely confronts a vampire spawn chasing a young girl, declaring the Morninglord’s blessing upon him. His resolve is unwavering, but the spawn’s superior speed and strength overwhelm him. In a swift, brutal motion, the creature tears out his throat.

Ziva watches with sorrow but urges Sally to press onward. There is no time to mourn—their mission is clear. The church must be re-consecrated before Strahd arrives.

As Sally charges through the streets, her paws pounding against the cobblestones, Ziva glances over her shoulder. Ludmilla, with her vampiric speed, begins to close the gap, her presence a dark shadow in the chaos that engulfs Vallaki.

As Ziva conveys this information, Sally presses onward, resolute in her mission to reach the church with the bones and re-consecrate it. She sprints at full speed through the chaos, but her momentum is suddenly interrupted by a beam of bluish arcane energy. The spell lifts her into the air, her limbs still moving as though running, yet she remains suspended. Ludmilla’s **Levitate** spell has taken hold.

High above the city, Ziva’s body seizes up as her vision goes black. She loses her grip on Sally’s fur and plummets to the cobblestone street below, landing painfully and dropping the bag of bones in the process. As Ziva struggles to rise, she realizes she has been struck by a **Blindness** spell, leaving her unable to see or locate the precious bones.

Across the city, Tian makes his way toward the Blue Water Inn, gliding over rooftops with purpose. Along the way, he comes upon Captain Izek Strazni and a contingent of Vallaki guards locked in combat with a vampire spawn. As Izek’s gaze falls on Tian, he freezes, momentarily stunned. “It’s not possible,” he mutters, before recovering just in time to block an attack from the spawn. Tian swoops in to assist, and together they quickly dispatch the creature.

As the battle ends, Izek approaches Tian, his expression filled with astonishment. Once again, he exclaims that this cannot be possible, before revealing that he has been waiting for Tian for a long time. Tian is caught off guard, accustomed to fear or suspicion from the people of Barovia, not this stunned reverence. When he voices his confusion, Izek reveals that Tian is his long-lost brother.

Shaken, Tian listens as Izek recounts the tragic story: when Izek was five years old, his family was attacked by wolves. Their parents were killed, and his infant brother was lost in the chaos. Izek, was taken in and raised by Vallaki’s burgomaster, Vargas. Despite his new life, Izek never stopped searching for his brother, commissioning Blinsky to craft dolls in the likeness of a black-feathered aarakocra every week.

Tian recalls that the party had previously found one of these dolls, eerily resembling him. Though overwhelmed by this revelation, he doesn’t dismiss it outright. But before he can process everything, he spots Sally suspended in the air above the city—without Ziva on her back. Tian deduces that Ziva must have fallen and urges Izek to delay their discussion. With Strahd approaching Vallaki, there are more immediate threats. Tian pleads with Izek to survive the night and promises they will talk later.

Meanwhile, Sally acts quickly. Tapping into her **Radiant Soul** abilities, she manifests angelic wings that sprout from her direwolf form, allowing her to fly despite Ludmilla’s spell. Ludmilla, having emerged from an alley near Ziva’s fall, smirks at the scene. Ziva attempts to drive her back with **Dissonant Whispers**, but Ludmilla endures the spell, spots the fallen bag of bones, and retrieves it. She takes off running once more.

Tian implores Izek once again to help him and his friends and without hesitation, Izek, wielding his greataxe, joins the pursuit. His feathered arm extends, launching a flurry of dart-like feathers that strike Ludmilla. Though wounded, she recovers quickly, turning into mist and teleporting to a rooftop. From the shadows, her voice carries through the night: the townsfolk believe their burgomaster’s protections keep Strahd at bay, but in truth, Strahd has simply never cared enough to visit Vallaki. That, she declares, is about to change.

Tian leaps onto a rooftop, following Ludmilla’s trail, while Izek rallies his guards, instructing them to protect the burgomaster’s house. Sally descends to check on Ziva, finding her battered but alive. Ziva insists that Sally follow Ludmilla and recover the bones. Sally nods her snout and takes off after Ludmilla while Ziva, still blinded, fumbles through the debris in an attempt to orient herself.

As the pursuit continues, Tian and Sally notice Ludmilla’s wounds healing completely. She pauses briefly, looking skyward, before abruptly changing direction, running with new urgency. Meanwhile, Tian spots an unsettling scene below: two young men strike an elderly man over the head and begin looting his home, taking advantage of the chaos. Elsewhere in the city center, dozens of bodies litter the streets—most of them prisoners who had been shackled in the stocks.

Ziva casts **Locate Object** on the bones, so she can sense the direction of the bones. She slowly navigates toward the bones, her blindness amplifying her sense of helplessness. Tian and Sally lose sight of Ludmilla as she vanishes into the narrow streets. 

Tian reunites with Izek and reports seeing a spawn attacking the burgomaster’s mansion, where twelve guards struggle to hold it off. Izek decides to prioritize protecting the mansion and heads in that direction with Tian following close behind.

Tian and Izek rush to the burgomaster’s house, joining the guards locked in a desperate battle against a vampire spawn. Together, they manage to bring the creature down, with Tian landing the final blow. As the fight concludes, Izek turns to Tian, his voice heavy with emotion. He confesses that he has waited for this reunion for so long, consumed by an obsession to find his lost brother. Izek vows he will not lose Tian again.

Tian mentions the discovery of the toy resembling him, alarming Izek, who fears that Blinski might have revealed something. Tian reassures him, explaining that a little girl had been playing with it when he found it. Izek insists they need to talk further and pledges his support, asking how he can help. Tian warns him of Strahd’s imminent arrival and the futility of the so-called protections placed on Vallaki by the burgomaster. Though Izek wants to believe in the city’s safety, he knows the truth in his heart.

Tian urges Izek to prepare for a fight, and Izek begins organizing his guards. Taking to the skies, Tian scans the city, searching for any sign of Ludmilla, Sally, or Ziva. He spots neither, but his gaze falls on a flock of ravens circling above the Blue Water Inn, where a vampire spawn prowls toward its doors. Descending quickly, he informs Izek of the situation, and the two set off toward the inn, determined to stop the threat.

The newly found brothers reach the inn and encounter a feral vampire spawn terrorizing the townsfolk. The creature lunges at them, snarling that they present a worthy challenge. Before Tian can react, the spawn grapples him, sinking its fangs into his shoulder. Izek roars in rage, striking the spawn repeatedly with his greataxe, vowing to never lose his brother again.

Despite Izek’s efforts, the spawn’s grip tightens as its claws rake Tian’s neck. Struggling against the creature, Tian manages to break free and sprints toward the inn. Inside, frightened townsfolk stare at the battle unfolding outside. One of them spots Tian and, mistaking him for a threat, shouts in panic.

As Tian retreats, the spawn gives chase, leaping onto his back and tearing into him with claws and teeth. Tian collapses, blood pooling beneath him as unconsciousness overtakes him. The spawn looms over its prey, savoring the moment, but Izek charges forward with a deafening roar. He tears the spawn away from Tian, slamming it into the ground with brute force.

The inn’s doors burst open as Ireena rushes out, her adrenaline giving her the strength to drag Tian’s limp body back to safety. Inside, she works frantically to stabilize him, stopping the worst of the bleeding just in time and saving his life. Dannika, witnessing the scene, produces a healing potion and administers it to Tian, who slowly regains consciousness.

Tian awakens to chaos. The inn is overcrowded with terrified townsfolk seeking refuge. Upon seeing his outstretched wings, panic erupts among the crowd. Children cry, and adults shout in fear. Dannika and Ireena step in to calm the mob, assuring everyone that Tian is not a threat.

Grateful for their help, Tian thanks them and asks for Urwin. Ireena, still shaken, demands to know what is happening and where Sally and Ziva are. She explains that she had tried to leave earlier but was forced back inside by a swarm of ravens. Dannika, her demeanor calm but firm, directs Tian and Ireena to the attic to speak with Urwin. She promises that Urwin will explain the ravens’ involvement.

Before heading upstairs, Tian warns Dannika that Strahd is coming. Panic flashes across her face, but she masks it quickly. Ireena pleads with Tian not to leave her behind, insisting that she can help. Tian promises they will face whatever comes together but insists on speaking with Urwin first.

Tian, following Dannika's directions, heads to the Martikovs' bedroom and locates the hidden hatch leading to the attic. As he ascends, the sound of frantic wings flapping grows louder, reverberating through the confined space. Reaching the attic, he steps into a small triangular chamber. Four straw nests litter the floor, and an opening in the roof allows the cold night air to seep in.

In the center of the space, Tian spots a man kneeling, his back to him, surrounded by a swirling mass of ravens. The birds take turns perching on the man’s shoulders, staying for brief moments before flitting away into the shadows. As Tian moves closer, he recognizes the figure as Urwin, his eyes closed and lips moving in a whispered litany.

Grabbing Urwin’s hand, Tian jolts him out of his trance, causing the flock of ravens to scatter in a flurry of feathers and shrill cries. Urwin blinks rapidly, the spell broken, and meets Tian’s gaze. He acknowledges that Tian has discovered their secret, the very reason Dannika allowed him into the attic. There is much to discuss, but the dire circumstances leave no time for lengthy explanations.

Tian quickly recounts the events leading up to this moment: the party’s discovery of Heinrich’s traps, the confrontation with Ludmilla and her spawn, and the theft of the sacred bones now in Ludmilla’s possession. Urwin admits to knowing some of this but reveals he has been using his ravens to delay Ludmilla’s progress wherever possible. His connection to the ravens is part of a covert network, and their activities must remain hidden. He insists that his focus has been on gathering information rather than direct confrontation.

When Tian mentions Strahd’s imminent arrival, Urwin visibly pales. Tian asks how they can protect everyone in Vallaki, but Urwin’s grim response offers little comfort—they can’t. The situation is bleak, and their efforts must focus on the immediate threat. He informs Tian that Ziva and Sally are currently locked in battle with Ludmilla. Tian must go to them without delay.

Tian hesitates, reluctant to bring Ireena outside and into the chaos. However, Urwin warns that the protections around the inn will not withstand Strahd’s power. Ireena must stay with Tian, as remaining here is no longer safe. Urwin explains that his organization, the **Keepers of the Feather**, has long fought Strahd in secret, gathering intelligence and striking in subtle ways. By revealing their existence, he is placing his trust in Tian and, by extension, his companions. He pleads with Tian to protect their secret.

Before parting, Urwin questions whether Izek can be trusted. Tian hesitates but reveals the possibility that Izek is his brother. Urwin seems to find this revelation illuminating but urges Tian to save deeper conversations for later. For now, survival is the priority. He hands Tian three Greater Healing Potions, urging him to stay alive.

Tian leaves the attic, descending quickly to find Ireena. He tells her they must stick together and that he knows where the others are. There is no time to waste.

Tian, Ireena, and Izek emerge near the inn, where chaos reigns. In front of them, Izek and a surviving guard are locked in a brutal struggle with a feral spawn. Another guard lies motionless at their feet, his lifeless body a grim reminder of the stakes.

Tian surges forward, his spear flashing as he unleashes a flurry of precise strikes, stunning the spawn. Izek, emboldened by Tian’s return, fights with renewed vigor, cleaving one of the creature’s arms with a mighty swing of his greataxe. Tian ascends swiftly into the air, then dives with calculated precision, driving his spear deep into the spawn’s chest. The creature gasps once before collapsing lifelessly to the cobblestones.

Wasting no time, Tian beckons Ireena and Izek to follow. As they prepare to move, a guard approaches Izek, breathless and bloodied, to deliver a report on the spawn’s movements. One detail captures Tian’s attention—a spawn has terrorized the orphanage but has since moved on. The implications are chilling, but there is no time to investigate further.

Guided by flashes of unnatural lightning streaking through the night sky, the group races toward the heart of the conflict. The sounds of battle grow louder with each step until they reach the end of an alleyway. There, amidst the flickering light and shadows, they see Sally and Ziva locked in a desperate struggle against Ludmilla. The air is charged with tension as the fight reaches its peak.

---

Meanwhile, as Tian leaves with Izek to defend the burgomaster’s house, Sally returns to Ziva, nudging her to climb back onto her back. Just as Ziva settles into place, her vision returns as the **Blindness** spell ends. Sensing the bones through her spell, she directs Sally toward their location. Sally’s wings vanish as the **Radiant Soul** effect fades, but with the **Levitate** spell also ending, she resumes running at full speed toward Ludmilla, with Ziva guiding her.

Sally races through the narrow alleys, Ziva clinging to her back and guiding her. Amid the chaos, Ziva notices a young man emerging from a shadowed alley, a sinister smile on his face as he watches the panic unfold. Raising his hand, he targets a fleeing woman, and a pulse of arcane energy freezes her in her tracks. Her expression goes blank as she moves to a wall and begins slamming her head against it with alarming force. Blood streaks the stone before she collapses.

The young man releases his hold, and the woman regains consciousness, screaming in terror at the sight of her injuries. Ziva recognizes the man as Victor Vallakovich, matching Sally’s description from the night before. Before Ziva can act, Victor vanishes, casting **Invisibility** on himself. Ziva alerts Sally, stating that Victor’s actions will need to be addressed soon.

As Sally pushes forward, Ziva notices tears streaking the direwolf’s fur. The devastation and loss have taken their toll on her. Gently, Ziva pats Sally, urging her to focus on their mission as there will be time to grieve later, when the situation has been brought back under control.

Suddenly, the pull of the bones from Ziva’s *Locate Object* spell shifts, signaling that Ludmilla has stopped. The two find themselves in a dark alley where Ziva senses the bones nearby. A swarm of ravens circles a young girl ahead, pecking at her and holding her back. Sensing an illusion, Ziva urges Sally forward. The ravens scatter, revealing a clear path to the girl.

The "girl" attempts to play the part of an orphan, but Ziva calls her by her real name, seeing through the ruse. Ludmilla, amused by their insight, drops the act and asks for their name. Ziva, dismissing their names as unimportant, states that Ludmilla has something that belongs to the town of Vallaki, referring to the bag of bones. Smiling darkly, Ludmilla taunts them to come and take it from her. 

Sally shakes Ziva off her back, her direwolf form trembling with barely contained radiance as her fury intensifies.

Ziva attempts to cast **Command** on Ludmilla, aiming to force her to drop the bag of bones. However, Ludmilla, having learned from Ziva’s earlier attempt, has secured the bag tightly to her belt, rendering the spell ineffective. With a sly tone, Ludmilla questions whether Ziva and Sally truly wish to engage in this fight, suggesting they might have more pressing matters to attend to. Her words turn sharper as she inquires about Ireena, mocking them with the implication that they’ve hidden her away somewhere.

Tension snaps like a bowstring, and a violent clash erupts between the three women. Ludmilla taunts her opponents with venom, calling Sally a "mutt" and assuring them they’ve yet to witness her full power. Ziva retaliates, casting **Hold Person** and telling Ludmilla mockingly that they should have a proper conversation like adults. The spell takes hold, paralyzing Ludmilla in place.

Seizing the opportunity, Sally lunges forward, her jaws snapping shut on Ludmilla’s neck in a feral, critical strike. The force of the attack sends Ludmilla sprawling to the ground, prone and vulnerable. Paralyzed, she struggles to regain her composure but soon shakes off the magical effect, snarling at Ziva with a promise to end her life.

Ziva darts forward, attempting to rip the bag of bones from Ludmilla’s belt. However, the bag is fastened too securely. Turning to Sally, who is still in a frenzy, Ziva pleads with her to regain control, urging her to focus on their mission. If they fail to get the bones to the church, everything they’ve fought for will be meaningless, and Ireena will no longer be safe.

Ziva’s words pierce through Sally’s rage, grounding her in the urgency of their task. Sally turns her ferocity toward Ludmilla once more, tearing the bag of bones free from Ludmilla’s belt. With the bag clamped in her jaws, Sally bolts toward the church, ignoring Ludmilla’s swiping claws.

Ludmilla, however, refuses to relent. Using **Misty Step**, she teleports ahead of Sally, closing the distance in a heartbeat. With one swift motion, she tears the bag from Sally’s grasp and lashes out, her claws raking across Sally’s direwolf form. The force of the strike causes Sally to revert to her natural form, slightly injured.

Seeing Ludmilla once again in possession of the bag, Ziva teleports ahead with her own **Misty Step**, appearing in Ludmilla’s path. She reaches for the bones, but Ludmilla bats her hand away with mocking ease, taunting Ziva further. Sally, now back in her humanoid form, calls upon the storm overhead. Lightning descends from the heavens as she casts *Call Lightning*, scorching Ludmilla. Transforming into a Nyxborn Lynx, a form imbued with resistance to magical effects, Sally prepares to continue the fight.

Ludmilla, singed but unfazed, smirks and counters with a **Lightning Bolt**, striking both Ziva and Sally. The attack leaves Ziva barely standing and disrupts Sally’s concentration on her spell. Ziva, battered, summons an **Aura of Vitality** to heal herself and presses forward, though her attempt to reclaim the bones fails once more.

As Sally lunges at Ludmilla, trying to rip the bag away, Ludmilla gracefully evades, her mocking laughter echoing through the alley. With predatory focus, Ludmilla turns her attention back to Ziva, slashing at her with ruthless precision. Ziva, bloodied but determined, puts her right hand in Ludmilla’s face and pushes her back with a burst of radiant energy from **Sacred Flame**, searing her face.

Sally strikes Ludmilla again and heals herself in preparation for the next assault. Ludmilla, seemingly unbothered by their increasingly desperate efforts, prepares to deliver a killing blow to Ziva. But as her gaze shifts, she notices movement at the end of the alley. Tian, Izek, and Ireena are racing toward them. Ludmilla’s expression twists into a smile as her eyes settle on Ireena. Declaring it “wonderful” that Ireena has arrived, Ludmilla turns and sprints toward the church, her interest in the fight seemingly waning.

Ziva, her wounds still fresh, gathers her strength and heals herself once more. With a determined breath, she charges after Ludmilla, making one final, desperate attempt to seize the bag of bones. The force of her movement helps her pry the bag free from Ludmilla's belt, her fingers slipping it from the clasp.

Regaining her footing, Ziva extends her left hand toward Ludmilla, her moon tattoo darkening ominously. A surge of divine energy erupts from her as she channels her power to **Turn Undead**. The pulse of radiant force hits Ludmilla, causing her pupils to widen in shock. The power of Ziva’s abjuration surrounds her, and Ludmilla’s presence is suddenly and violently expelled.

Unable to withstand the divine energy, Ludmilla, terrified, stumbles backward, her steps faltering at first, then accelerating into a frantic retreat. She sprints away from Ziva, driven by the pure need to escape.

As the undead threat retreats, Ziva yells to the others that Ludmilla is no longer a concern. The party regroups as Tian, Izek, and Ireena arrive. Ziva hands the bag of bones to Sally, trusting her speed to deliver them to the church. The group dashes through the rain-soaked streets, Ziva using the last of her **Aura of Vitality** to heal everyone, including Izek, whose confusion is palpable as his wounds vanish.

Ireena’s relief is evident as she sees her companions alive, though battered. She briefly inquires about Tian’s connection to Izek, prompting Tian to reveal they are brothers. The revelation shocks Ziva, Sally, and Ireena, but there is no time for discussion. The mission takes precedence, and they continue their desperate run to the church.

As they race onward, Ziva feels the familiar tug of a **Sending** spell. Opening her mind warily, she hears a gruff male voice saying the following: *“That was well done. You and your companions can do better with training, but it was decent for a first interaction.I would recommend you be more mindful of your position when fighting such creatures next time.”*

Ziva attempts to respond, demanding to know the sender’s identity, but the connection fades, leaving her with no answer.

As the party approaches the church, the desolation of the scene strikes a chord of unease. The once-hallowed grounds are devoid of people, the flickering glow of fires from the burning city casting long, jagged shadows against the rain-soaked walls. The relentless downpour does little to quell the oppressive atmosphere.

A blazing light draws their attention to the churchyard, its brilliance cutting through the gloom. As they draw closer, the source reveals itself: a massive, dark horse of terrifying majesty. Its eyes, mane, tail, and hooves burn with eternal flames, unyielding to the rain. The beast stands like a sentinel, unbothered by the chaos around it.

To the side of the church steps, two figures kneel—one appears to be a child, their quiet sobs barely audible over the storm. Before the church’s grand doors, seated on a throne of mist, is Strahd. He watches the party's approach with a patient, knowing smile, exuding an unsettling calm.

Strahd’s gaze remains fixed on the group, but a sudden movement from the darkness interrupts the stillness. Ludmilla emerges, keeping her distance as she approaches her master. Her trembling form kneels far from him, visibly shaken. She is empty-handed, the bag of bones absent from her grasp. Strahd had entrusted her with a task—to bring him the bones—and now she stands before him in failure.

Strahd listens as Ludmilla pleads for forgiveness, stammering excuses about the interference of ravens and the party’s meddling. At the mention of the ravens, Strahd’s smile widens, his expression momentarily pleased by the revelation. He interrupts her, his voice smooth but final, relieving her of her duties. He commands her to return to Ravenloft and await his return, dismissing her protests and her plea for a chance to redeem herself by killing the party. With a final bow, Ludmilla vanishes into the night, her figure swallowed by the shadows.

Izek, unable to contain his fury, roars a challenge to Strahd, accusing him of cowardice for sitting idly while issuing commands. Before the party can intervene, Izek charges recklessly at the vampire lord. Strahd raises a single finger, a streak of arcane energy crackling forth and striking Izek with devastating precision. The captain collapses, lifeless and unmoving.

Strahd rises from his misty throne, stepping closer to the party. His calm demeanor remains intact as he informs them that Izek is not dead, merely incapacitated. He claims to seek conversation, not bloodshed—decorum, as he calls it.

His gaze shifts to Ireena, who stands pale and trembling under his scrutiny. A charming smile spreads across his face as he compliments her beauty, his words laced with unsettling familiarity. Turning to the rest of the party, he greets them as esteemed guests, commending their persistence in reaching this point. His eyes linger on Ziva, his amusement apparent as he mentions her resourcefulness in reuniting with her companions, contrasting her to Teela, who came to him willingly.

Ziva masks her apprehension with a polite smile, probing Strahd about Teela’s fate under the guise of understanding the standards by which she is measured. Strahd laughs softly, evading her inquiry, and assures her only that Teela is alive—for now.

The vampire lord acknowledges the party’s efforts in safeguarding Ireena, expressing that their relationship with him must now evolve. His tone shifts as he addresses each of them, inquiring about their personal desires.

Sally declares her drive to protect the innocent, a sentiment Strahd dismisses as narrow-minded. Ziva calmly states that her motivation lies in her profession, the investigation she was undertaking when she arrived in Barovia, and her intention to see it through. Strahd acknowledges her resolve with interest. When Tian admits his desire for power to protect those he cares about, Strahd nods in understanding, remarking that this concept resonates deeply with him.

Strahd confesses that he previously dismissed the party as mere fools but now finds them intriguing. He invites them to guess why, his patience growing thin when they hesitate. Ziva speculates, suggesting he might be bored and in need of entertainment, while Tian proposes that they may have interfered with his plans. Strahd, pleased by their observations, concedes that he underestimated their resolve and tenacity.

His demeanor becomes more animated as he admits his delight in being proven wrong—a rarity for someone of his experience and age. However, his tone sharpens as he reveals the deeper truth: the party has attempted something that he could not allow to happen, something that demands his direct intervention.

Ziva steps forward, her voice calm but curious, asking Strahd to clarify his focus. What exactly has the party interrupted? Why does the church suddenly matter so much when he has ignored it for so long?

Strahd's smile broadens as he turns to Sally, gesturing toward the bag of bones. He explains that while he could take them by force, he would prefer civility. With an air of tense reluctance, Sally steps forward, handing over the bag. She questions why he would need them, her voice laced with both suspicion and defiance.

Accepting the bag with a flourish, Strahd chuckles softly, promising an explanation. A sudden, anguished sob cuts through the air, drawing the party’s attention to the two kneeling figures nearby. Their realization comes like a blow—Father Lucian and the altar boy, Yeska, are kneeling in front of the church, paralysed by fear and forced to witness this grim scene.

Strahd turns back to the party, his gaze sharp and almost mocking as he asks if they know who "Saint" Andral truly was. Ziva responds cautiously, recounting that Andral was a priest of the Morninglord, a warrior, and a healer who lived centuries ago in this land.

Strahd scoffs, turning to Father Lucian, his tone shifting to a mix of derision and amusement. He demands Lucian’s version of Andral’s history. Trembling, the priest musters an answer: Andral was sent to protect this land from darkness, from people like Strahd.

At this, Strahd laughs—a chilling sound that echoes in the rain. He admits he has left the city untouched for a century, yet the people have still sinned of their own volition. He taunts Lucian, asking what horrors have been whispered into his confessional over the years. Reluctantly, under Strahd's imposing glare, Lucian confesses that he has borne witness to countless sins, powerless to stop the people who committed them.

Satisfied, Strahd begins to recount Andral’s story. He describes the man as a priest of the Morninglord, but also, once, his friend. Andral arrived with Strahd’s father’s armies, seeking to spread the Morninglord’s faith to the primitive peoples of Barovia. He was a trusted advisor, often tempering Strahd’s wrath.

But Andral’s rigid adherence to his faith created a rift. He abandoned Strahd, alongside his fiery protégé, Markovia. Despite this, Andral’s influence spread, and the Morninglord’s faith took root across the land. Strahd recalls how Andral and his followers betrayed him, rose in rebellion against him, even consecrating this very church as a sanctuary against him.

The church was once Andral’s home and he declared that as long as he is in his home, everyone inside is protected from Strahd. Strahd describes how the church became a refuge for Andral and his followers, a self-sustaining community living in defiance of his power. But their defiance did not last. Strahd lured Andral out and killed him before his followers. Only later did he discover that Andral’s remains, buried here, had consecrated the church against his influence.

Turning his attention back to the bag, Strahd's smile hardens. The bones begin to levitate, glowing faintly in the dim light. With a casual flick of his wrist, he sets them ablaze. The sacred relics disintegrate before the party’s eyes, leaving behind only ashes.

Father Lucian breaks down, wailing and praying to the Morninglord for salvation. Strahd watches him coldly, then leans in close, his voice low and mocking. He calls Andral a fool with a streak of luck and tells Lucian that if he is praying for salvation, it should be from Strahd, not his absent god. With another flick of his wrist, Strahd decapitates the priest in one brutal motion.

Yeska screams for Lucian, paralyzed by fear and grief. Strahd silences him with a sharp glare, his voice dismissive but calm. When Ziva pleads for the boy’s life, Strahd rebuffs her, stating coldly that she does not dictate his actions. However, he assures her that he has no intention of killing Yeska, only silencing him.

Turning back to the party, Strahd explains his actions. The church’s protection could not be allowed to continue, especially as it would have served to keep his "beloved" Ireena out of his reach. He remarks that the party’s interference has awakened a part of him long dormant—a part that is deeply intrigued by them.

Strahd’s gaze softens as it lands on Ireena, who clings to Sally’s hand, trembling. He addresses her as *“his love”*, questioning how much longer she will resist him. How much time does she need to accept the inevitability of his affection?

Ireena, her voice shaking but resolute, accuses him of madness. She demands to know how he could ever believe she would accept him after all he has done to her, her family, and her people.

Strahd urges her to consider his words carefully. He claims to be her constant in a world full of betrayal and lies. While others plot and scheme, he remains steadfast. He admits his past brashness but insists that he is not the source of her suffering. The atrocities inflicted on her people are not his doing, but the result of mortal greed and cruelty.

Ireena, her voice trembling with defiance, demands to know how Strahd is any different from the horrors he condemns. He takes what he wants, parading his dominion over these lands with impunity. Strahd interrupts, his tone cold and measured, claiming that he does not take what he wants but what is needed. He insists that he has long since shed the shallow desires of mortals, leaving behind their tropes and indulgences centuries ago.

He continues, his words heavy with bitterness, explaining that Ireena does not yet understand the burdens he carries. The path ahead, he warns, is laden with weight and sacrifice. Strahd speaks of a time when he was stripped of his youth and thrust into circumstances where none of his decisions benefited anyone. It is easy to judge, he says, when one knows only a single side of the coin. Yet it was harsh choices, born of necessity, that chipped away at him through the ages. These choices, he claims, are what shape lands and forge dynasties.

Strahd recounts his past, how he fought in his father’s wars, how he provided for his kingdom, and how he cast aside his own happiness for the sake of others. He declares that he has sacrificed everything—for love. For Ireena. And when all else has faded, when betrayal and death claim everyone she holds dear, he will remain. Time, he reminds her, is a commodity he has in abundance. He offers her the peace she desires, a peace that only he can provide.

Enraged, Ireena rejects him, her voice rising with fury. She accuses him of sacrificing nothing for her, dismissing his words as the manipulations of a tyrant. To her, she is nothing more than another consort, another of his desires taken by force.

Strahd’s expression shifts, his anger tightly masked behind a strained smile. He assures her that she will understand in time. She is far more to him than a mere consort. She and his anger are the only two things that keep his cold, dead heart alive.

Mounting his magnificent steed, Strahd’s gaze sweeps across the party. He meets the eyes of each member, acknowledging their respect and returning it, though his words carry an ominous weight. The party does not understand the magnitude of their situation, he says, but they have shown him respect, so he will do the same. Strahd declares that none of them wanted to come to this land—just as he never wanted to be here. He did not summon them; this is Madame Eva’s infuriating game.

Strahd asserts his invincibility, proclaiming that he is Ancient, that he is the Land itself. The curse upon the land is his curse, and his curse is to pursue Ireena. He recounts his endless attempts to claim her, how he has kidnapped her, kept her captive in Ravenloft, allowed her to grow old and die without seeing his face, courted her, and driven her to rebel against him. Each time, though she has lived under many names, the result has always been the same. But now, he realizes, the choice is not his—it is hers. She must accept him wholly and willingly. She must give her light to the darkness to forge a new path for the land and all who dwell within it.

Turning to Ireena one last time, Strahd calls her by the name “Tatyana” and implores her to stop being selfish. His voice carries a haunting sincerity as he makes his final plea.

With that, Strahd urges his steed forward. The horse gallops into the night, its hooves silent as if riding on the wind. Before disappearing entirely, Strahd turns his attention to the people of Vallaki. Addressing the town, he reveals the burgomaster’s lies. He has not stayed away because of the so-called protections; he stayed away because he simply was not interested. The townsfolk, Strahd reminds them, live at his mercy, and they would do well not to forget that.

As Strahd vanishes into the mist, his departure is met with cries and wails rising from the townspeople of Vallaki. Fear and despair ripple through the crowd, a chilling reminder of the darkness that now looms closer than ever.

Rain pours relentlessly as the muffled screams of villagers echo through the streets, reacting to Strahd’s words. Ireena kneels, crying, while Izek remains unconscious. Yeska sobs hopelessly over Father Lucian’s lifeless body.

Sally tries to console Ireena but presses the urgency of the situation—Strahd’s spawn are still loose, and people are dying. Ziva also attempts to reach her, urging her to hold on a little longer; there is still work to be done, and rest must wait. Stepping toward Yeska, Ziva lifts him into her arms and carries him inside the church. He clings to her, sobbing even harder.

Sally reminds Ireena of her determination, insisting she can still help. Ireena, overwhelmed, explodes in frustration, demanding to know how she is anything but a burden beyond Strahd’s creatures refusing to attack her. She begs Sally to tell her how she can help because right now, she feels like nothing more than a pawn with no agency.

Sally counters that it is up to Ireena to decide whether she is useful or useless—she must gather herself. Furious at Sally’s lack of empathy after everything she has just learned, Ireena declares she needs to be alone and storms off.

Sally calls after her, asking if she can at least watch over Yeska to prevent him from running off or dying. Ireena, even angrier, accuses Sally of coddling her. Sally, frustrated, explains that they need to hunt the spawn, and Ireena is in no condition to fight. It is her choice whether to prove Strahd right or wrong.

Ireena, now seething, resents that Sally is minimizing her feelings. She has just learned that she has always been Strahd’s coveted treasure, across lifetimes. Tian attempts to calm her, sharing that he has been at death’s door three times since arriving in this cursed land. Each time, he has found the strength to return because of his friends. As long as kindness still exists in Barovia, he will lay down his life to protect it—that is his choice. If he can keep fighting, then so can she.

Ireena, exasperated, cannot understand why no one grasps the depth of her despair. She needs time to process what she is feeling. Right now, nothing seems to matter—her life is forfeit, and there is no escape from Strahd.

When she first touched the rapier, she saw something—a vision she dismissed as Vistani magic or a figment of imagination. She stood in Castle Ravenloft, bathed in sunlight, happier than ever before. A man—one who resembled Strahd—stood beside her, teaching her the proper stance for wielding a blade. Now, with the knowledge she possesses, she understands that this was not an illusion but a memory from a past life.

Strahd has hunted her through every lifetime. Not only is her current life forfeit, but so are all the lives she will ever live.

Sally, exasperated, turns away and leaves. Tian tries once more, telling Ireena that what he has heard is the story of a brave woman. Ireena snaps, shouting at him and Sally’s retreating figure, calling them both thick and pigheaded. She insists she will not stop fighting—not now, not ever—but she needs time to regain her composure.

Sally, fuming, grabs the healer’s kit and moves to stabilize Izek. With Tian’s help, she manages to patch him up.

Ziva carries Yeska to his room and asks if he will be all right, explaining that the party still has business to attend to in the city. Yeska gives no response—he is completely shattered.

Ireena enters the church, finds Ziva, and, in a monotone voice, tells her to go. She will stay with Yeska.

When Ziva asks if she wants to join the party, Ireena simply states that there is nothing she can do to help. Ziva disagrees but acknowledges that this is not the time for such a discussion. Placing a hand on Ireena’s shoulder, she tells her to stay safe. Before leaving, she suggests giving Yeska some of the tea Tian bought from Jenny to help him sleep.

Sally and Tian work to stabilize Izek, who remains unresponsive. As they tend to him, six guards approach.

The guards demand to know who they are and what they want. Upon seeing Izek’s condition, they draw their weapons and order the party to step away.

Tian attempts to explain that Izek is his kin, but the guards immediately call him a monster as well. Sally, frustrated, snaps at them, demanding to know if they want their captain’s blood on their hands while she is clearly trying to save him.

Tian further explains that Izek charged Strahd alone. When the guards ask if Strahd was truly here, Tian confirms it and asks about the remaining spawn.

The guards repeat their demand for identification. Ziva raises her voice, introducing each party member and stating that they are in the employ of Burgomaster Vargas Vallakovich. She stresses that time is of the essence—they can either help or stand aside.

The guards reveal that three spawn remain. One was last seen near the town square, another near the Arasaka Stockyard, and the third attacked the orphanage and the Wachterhaus before being driven out of town by Wachter guards.

Another group of guards has escorted the burgomaster to the Reformation Center, a designated safe location.

Ziva retrieves Father Lucian’s head, places it beside his body, and covers the remains with his cloak. She briefly considers searching the now-empty burgomaster’s house upon the realization that the noble family will not emerge from hiding until the town is secured and the threat eliminated.

With no time to waste, the party sets out to hunt the remaining spawn, riding direwolves conjured by Sally and guided by ravens leading them toward their targets.

As the party approaches the city center, the ravens circle overhead, signaling that one of the vampire spawn is nearby.

Ziva casts **Thaumaturgy** on herself, amplifying her voice as she hurls taunts into the night, aiming to lure the creature out.

The strategy works. The spawn—an arrogant predator known for chasing beautiful women—erupts in fury at her mockery. Enraged, she abandons her hunt and rushes toward the party.

A battle ensues. Ziva casts **Spirit Guardians**, summoning a swirling aura of divine energy. But something is wrong. The right side of her body glows with radiant light, while the left side darkens with slick, inky ichor that drips from her hair and clothes like liquid shadow.

The spawn attempts to escape Ziva’s aura and lunges at Sally. However, she isn’t fast enough and is seared by the radiant energy. Seeing the attack coming, Ziva invokes her *Warding Flare*, releasing a burst of blinding light that causes the spawn’s strike to miss.

Sally retaliates with fire, scorching the creature. She then commands her summoned direwolves to attack.

From above, Tian descends in a blur, striking the spawn repeatedly with his fists.

Ziva, seething with rage, locks eyes with the creature—the same one that killed Piersym earlier. “Look at me,” she commands, her voice sharp with fury. “You will die by my hand tonight.”

The spawn, burning in her aura, panics and attempts to flee. Sally chases her down and strikes, but her attack misses.

Tian soars after her. Thinking of Piersym—the friend this creature had stolen from him—he drives his spear through her open mouth, ending her undeath.

With one more spawn eliminated, the party moves swiftly toward the Arasaka Stockyard, where the last one was seen.

Upon arrival, the party is met with carnage. Bodies are strewn across the stockyard, torn apart. Amidst the slaughter, a vampire spawn—a man in his fifties—is drenched in blood, staring at the massacre around him in disbelief.

The party approaches cautiously. Ziva steps forward and demands to know where the others are.

The spawn lifts his gaze to them, eyes hollow with despair. “Kill me,” he begs. Ignoring his plea for the moment, Ziva presses for answers. “What was the plan? How long have you been here?”

The spawn shudders but relents. “Three weeks,” he murmurs. “My name is Aaron. I was a farmer. I... I don’t remember how I became this.” Once more, he begs for death.

Ziva studies him for a moment before nodding. “Then kneel.” Aaron obeys, falling to his knees before her and closing his eyes. As Ziva steps closer, her radiant aura engulfs him. “May Lathander have mercy on your soul,” she whispers. The light consumes him, and the spawn is no more.

With the last of the creatures dealt with, the party sets its next objectives: checking on the orphanage and searching the burgomaster’s house.

Sally heads to the orphanage, while Ziva and Tian rush toward the mansion.

Sally approaches the orphanage and spots mercenaries hired by the Wachter family standing guard. She asks if the Wachter family is safe and, upon receiving confirmation, proceeds forward.

The orphanage windows are boarded up, though light flickers from within. On the steps, a body lies motionless. Stepping closer, Sally turns the figure over and recognizes Milivoj, the gravedigger.

She calls out to Madame Belasco, asking if the children are safe. After a brief silence, Belasco’s voice answers from inside—the children are fine, and so is she. She adds that Milivoj saved them.

When Belasco asks if it is safe outside, Sally advises her to keep the children inside until the party ensures every spawn has been dealt with.

Belasco recounts what happened: when the attack began, she and Milivoj brought the children inside, barricading the doors and windows. Then, they heard a child outside, begging to be let in. When they opened the door, a vampire spawn lunged after the child. They tried to shut it out, but it was too late.

Milivoj grabbed his shovel and stepped outside, ordering Belasco to bolt the door behind him. The guards arrived and fought the creature, eventually driving it from the city—but Milivoj had already fallen.

Sally scans the area for any lingering threats. Finding none, she turns toward the burgomaster’s mansion to reunite with Ziva and Tian.

As they make their way to the burgomaster’s house, Ziva updates Tian on Victor’s suspicious behavior throughout the evening. She proposes they enter under the pretense of escorting the burgomaster and his family to safety.

Upon arriving, they find the main door locked and decide to sneak in quietly. Ziva **Misty Steps** inside and unlocks the door for Tian.

Inside, Ziva listens closely and hears the low, guttural growls of massive hounds—Vargas’s dogs, left behind to guard the mansion. She warns Tian before he steps in.

Realizing they are unfamiliar with the house’s layout, they decide to head for the attic, where Victor’s room should be, based on Sally’s descriptions. Moving cautiously upstairs, they reach a hallway and spot two massive hounds sleeping near a trapdoor leading to the attic.

They approach silently, hoping to reach the attic without disturbing the dogs. They also agree to check the master bedroom after investigating the attic.

As they strategize how to reach the trapdoor, a noise echoes from further down the corridor. Tian reacts instantly, pulling Ziva toward the sound to hide should the hounds wake.

Passing by a room lined with identical dolls resembling Tian, they deduce it must belong to Izek. They continue down the hall, stopping at a door bound with heavy chains.

Tian knocks, and Ziva presses her ear against the wood, hearing the rattle of chains from within. Tearing a page from her notebook, she scribbles a note asking who the occupant is and why they are imprisoned, then slides it under the door.

Realizing it is too dark for the person inside to read, she casts **Light** on her pencil and pushes it through the gap. A response comes: the prisoner asks who Ziva and Tian are.

As they converse, they learn the man is Udo Lucovich, a missing townsman imprisoned for speaking against Vargas at the last festival. He was beaten and left in chains for his defiance. Udo is alone but has no knowledge of other prisoners in the house.

Horrified by the injustice, Ziva and Tian decide to free him. To find the key, they head toward the master bedroom—only to realize they have no idea where it is.

Creeping carefully past the sleeping hounds, they enter the largest room they can find, only to discover a study filled with a vast collection of books.

Ziva searches the desk while Tian inspects the library. Among tax records, Ziva finds a list of inmates at the reformation center and their supervisors—three elves. The party takes some books from the Burgomaster’s collection.

Meanwhile, Sally arrives at the house with her wolf companions. She avoids the hounds and moves toward the attic, noticing light from the study. Seeing this, she carefully approaches. Inside, Ziva extinguishes the light while Tian waits at the door, ready to strike if needed. Recognizing the familiar way the light vanishes, Sally whispers to announce herself, narrowly avoiding Tian’s attack.

Reunited, the party devises a plan to distract the hounds. Sally commands her direwolves to lure them outside, clearing the way to the attic.

The attic is a dusty, 20-foot-wide space filled with old furniture covered in white sheets. Tian barricades the windows and seals the trapdoor to prevent Victor—who can turn invisible—from sneaking up on them. Ziva listens for any sign of movement before scanning for magical traps.

Tian insists that, based on Madame Eva’s reading, a powerful item must be here. Though skeptical, Ziva helps search. Sally moves toward Victor’s room but hesitates, wary of traps, before returning to the group.

Ziva rummages through crates until she finds an old treasure chest. Inside are tattered books and fragile fabrics, but at the bottom, she discovers a false compartment. Lifting it, she finds an old leather bundle wrapped around something.

Ignoring Ziva’s warning about curses, Tian eagerly unwraps it. Within lies a book, ancient yet miraculously intact. Its reddish leather cover is worn with age, the metal hinges rusted. An engraved coat of arms catches Ziva’s eye—Strahd von Zarovich’s crest.

Opening the tome, she immediately recognizes Strahd’s handwriting. The text appears encoded, filled with complex arcane magic. Only the title of the first page is legible: ***War and Peace**.* The party takes the book and moves toward Victor’s room. Sally casts **Dispel Magic** on the door.

Upon entering, the party notices a message carved into the wall with a knife: *“All is not well.”* Small bones litter the floor. In the corner, three small children stand with their backs to the room.

Sally recalls from her previous visit to the house when she was shapechanged into a cat that the magical drawing she saw earlier lies beneath the rug and advises the rest of the party to go around it. She picks up a gem from a nearby chest, casts **Light** on it, and throws it at one of the children. As the glow illuminates the room, the party realizes the figures are wooden mannequins, dressed to resemble people.

Sally moves to the desk, searching for books or documents belonging to Victor. Suddenly, Tian grows agitated, overcome with a deep sense of foreboding. He urges Sally and Ziva to leave immediately, convinced something—or someone—is coming. He insists they are in danger.

Heeding his warning, the party quickly retreats. Ziva glances outside but sees no one. Tian, still on edge, begs them to move faster. They escape through one of the attic windows, dropping into the street below. Sally shifts into a cat mid-fall, landing gracefully.

Despite seeing nothing, Ziva and Sally follow Tian’s urgency and sprint toward the inn. When they arrive, Tian hesitates. His overwhelming sense of impending doom has faded, and he now questions whether his fear was rational.

The party debates what happened. Ziva theorizes that Tian may have triggered an arcane trap when he touched the mannequins. Determined to investigate, they return to the Burgomaster’s house.

Sally hears the sound of hounds nearby. Ziva, unable to climb back up, suggests using the front door, but Sally quickly shapeshifts to warn her of the danger. Tian, despite his damaged wings, manages to fly onto the roof. Ziva remains below, prepared to create a distraction if necessary.

In Victor’s room, Tian senses nothing unusual. He and Sally find the space ransacked—Victor’s books, notes, and research are missing. The drawers are left half-open, stripped of their contents.

Sally notices the attic hatch ajar. Whoever took the research likely fled through it. She and Tian conclude that the culprit was Victor himself.

**@TODO:** Milos description add when first meet Milos

Istvan Milosovich or Milos

Milos is a stocky, athletic figure with the physique of someone accustomed to a lifetime of manual labour. His pale, dry skin bears numerous cuts and bruises across his torso—marks that seem to linger, refusing to fully heal. His short, dark hair is styled in a rough buzz cut, and his light green eyes shine with an unyielding intensity. A bushy beard and moustache obscure his upper lip and mouth, adding to his rugged demeanour.

He wears clean chainmail beneath a dark, weathered shirt. His left shoulder is protected by a battered, dented pauldron, while his right shoulder and arm are concealed by a cloak draped from his neck, covering half his chest and back. His attire is completed with a sturdy dark belt, leather pants, and well-worn boots, giving him a practical, battle-ready appearance.

Strapped to his back is a quiver containing five javelins, along with a simple heater shield mounted over it. His main weapon, a flail with a censer at the end of its chain, is coiled and hidden on his right side beneath the cloak.

Milos exudes a subtle but unnerving presence. Those who don’t know him well often find themselves uneasy in his company—feeling the hairs on their necks rise or experiencing a faint chill of dread, as if sensing an oppressive aura surrounding him.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**@TODO:** Milos Reading → get from Devy and integrate in story

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mists swirl, forming a vision with Tian, Sally, and Ireena witnessing a pivotal moment in the past. 

Shortly after meeting the Dawnmaster and uncovering the truth about the Balverzi assassin, the party watches Strahd claim the sinister red, black, and gold dagger, proclaiming, *"All goodness slipped from my life, all youth and vigour stripped from my body. All I have left is death."*

The scene shifts, transporting them to a well-furnished library with polished stone floors. Strahd sits in a chair, gripping a letter tightly, his knuckles white with tension. The letter is sealed with the wax emblem of the Von Zarovich family.

Dawnmaster Andral enters, his expression heavy with sorrow. He explains that he intended to deliver the news personally and laments the passing of Strahd’s mother, Queen Ravenovia. It seems she contracted an illness during the journey to Barovia, and the clerics of the Morninglord that were travelling with the royal family could not save her.

Strahd is visibly distraught. He had built Castle Ravenloft for her, and now she would never see it. Anguish flickers across his face as he crumples the letter in his hand.

Andral attempts to console him, saying that Queen Ravenovia is now with the Morninglord. However, Strahd rebuffs the sentiment sharply, reminding Andral that his purpose is to bring religion and civilization to Barovia. While the peasants might embrace the teachings of the Morninglord, Strahd himself has no interest. His tone is cold as he declares, *“I tolerate your god, but I will not let him guide my fate or my life.”*

After Strahd leaves the room, Andral lingers, lost in thought. He reminisces about his earlier days as a priest in Valentia, when he and a young Strahd would walk together in the gardens. Then, with a sigh, he exits as well.

Tian and Sally, left to explore the room, uncover a hidden chamber behind the fireplace. Inside, they discover a magically locked chest, intricately carved with delicate patterns. Despite their efforts, they cannot open it.

Moments later, Strahd returns, holding a key. With deliberate precision, he unlocks the chest, turning the key **three times to the right and twice to the left**. Within, they glimpse a small, ornate lockbox.

Before they can learn more, the swirling mists envelop the vision, and it fades to black.

The next morning, in the forest near Tser’s Pool, Ireena and Milos make their way to meet Luca, the villager they encountered the night before. Last night, Luca strapped himself to a tree because the full moon was out and he was beginning to transform into a werewolf. Milos recalls Luca carrying miner's tools, particularly a pickaxe, and quickly locates it before setting off after him on his warhorse, Moonshade. 

They soon find Luca, who looks ragged and worn. His clothes are torn, and his body is marked by deep wounds that don’t seem to have fully healed. 

Luca recognizes Ireena and knows who the **Shards of Dawn** are. He shares troubling news with her, explaining that he left the Village because things became increasingly dire. Ismark has spread word that the **Shards of Dawn** have killed his father, the previous burgomaster, kidnapped Ireena, and brought nightmarish creatures to Vallaki. As if that isn’t enough, Ismark exploits the villagers, especially the miners. Old man Laszlo has been appointed to oversee the mining operations, where workers are extracting gems and limestone for the village's new protector—a young wizard whom Milos quickly identifies as Victor. Luca also warns Ireena that Victor has placed magical traps all over the village. The mention of Laszlo causes Milos to tense up, and it is later revealed that Laszlo is Milos’s father. Milos’s anger is palpable—he wants nothing more than to kill his father and, if necessary, his mother as well.

Meanwhile, at camp, Ziva speaks with Arabelle, asking about the old woman in the hut who is rumored to sacrifice others. Arabelle reveals that she, too, experienced the same vision a year prior. When Arabelle asks Ziva if she ever had visions where she was the main character, and Ziva confirms it, Arabelle tenses up and hesitates to speak more on the matter. Sensing Arabelle’s discomfort, Ziva casts *Death Ward* on her before heading off to talk with Milos and Ireena. As Ziva discusses things with them, Tian approaches Milos with breakfast, but seeing the anger in Milos’s eyes, ultimately decides against it.

Later, Milos opens up to Ziva, under the influence of the *Calm Emotions* spell, revealing that he wishes to kill his own parents for how they treated him when he was young. His father was an alcoholic who beat him regularly, and his mother was a passive, mousy woman who allowed it to happen. Ziva can’t relate to his situation, but she asks him if he thinks killing them will make him feel better about it. Milos doesn’t know.

Meanwhile, Tian speaks with Izek, who admits that he is starting to feel things he has long feared, like compassion and ease. He also calls the party a bunch of cowards, which Milos takes in silence, clearly offended.

The party gathers their supplies and starts heading towards Tser’s Pool. On the way, Sally’s eyes are drawn to the noose she saw the last time she walked this road, but this time, instead of her own body swaying, she sees three nooses hanging, with three beautiful women dangling in the wind. Investigating further, Sally feels an unsettling sense of unease.

Upon arriving at the camp, the party is greeted by two guards waiting for them. Madame Eva has sensed their arrival and sent them ahead. While some of the Vistani offer food and drink, others eye the party warily, offering little more than cold stares. Everyone, however, bows to Arabelle as she passes through the camp. Araja, a familiar figure, helps Arabelle settle in. He also shares that strange tales are circulating from the village, likely influenced by Victor’s narrative. Additionally, there seems to be unusual and increased movement in the forest—Strahd’s beasts are becoming restless.

Madam Eva asks to see Milos to give him a reading. She speaks of a shrapnel in time, pain, and an unnatural aura around him. When she asks if the **Shards of Dawn** know about him, Milos confirms that Arabelle does, but the rest of the party remains unaware. Eva proceeds with her reading, revealing that Milos is somewhat removed from the tapestry of fate. She hints that, in the future, Milos will have to make decisions that will shape the course of events—choices between family and kin, radiance and sunlight, death and not living. She concludes by saying it is fascinating what Strahd has done to him, but leaves Milos with more questions than answers.

Eva then asks Milos to send in the “*31st*” a request he misinterprets as referring to Arabelle. However, Eva quickly corrects him and calls for Ireena instead. After their conversation, Ireena emerges looking disturbed and angry.

Afterwards, the party enters together, with Ireena remaining outside. Eva reveals that Ireena will need help moving forward. The Vistani matron shares more about the *Tome of Strahd*, revealing that the souls of those who die within its pages are trapped in the same way as those lost to the mists of Barovia. The book itself is not connected to the tapestry of fate. Strahd has recently visited Eva, inquiring about the *Tome*. He does not know the party has it, but he presumes they do. Once he knows for certain, he will seek it out.

Madame Eva also mentions Jenny, a very old figure who seems to have been forgotten by the people. She speaks about the *Raunis*, powerful seers in Vistani culture. There are limitations on their capabilities, and most Raunis cannot see their own threads of fate. There are three exceptions to this rule: Eva, Arabelle, and Ziva.

Madame Eva encourages the party to read from the *Tome* that night, assuring them that Strahd cannot see what transpires in this Vistani camp, as it is under her protection. She is also curious to learn how it feels when the *Tome* is read.

As the party gets up to leave, Ziva stays behind to ask Eva about her vision of the old woman in the hut. Eva confirms that the old woman Ziva keeps seeing in her visions is native to the land, but also cautions her that the woman is very powerful and dangerous. Ziva also asks about the man she is chasing, wanting to know if he is in Barovia as well. Madame Eva gives her a cryptic answer, saying that he is and, at the same time, is not in Barovia. Eva’s cryptic answers leave Ziva frustrated, but she bids the seer goodnight and leaves her caravan.

Ziva casts **Sending** to message Luvash and Arrigal about their safe arrival in the Vistani camp. Luvash is overjoyed that they are safe, but the message for Arrigal seems to not find purchase, and an answer never comes.

Izek and Milos later set out to hunt, successfully killing six wolves. They return to camp, covered in blood and pelts, making a dramatic entrance. A bond between the two begins to form. While waiting for them to return, Sally spends time comforting the distressed Ireena. Meanwhile, Tian and Ziva join the Vistani in their traditional dance, the *prestonata*.

Milos, eager to clean off the blood, heads into the water for a bath, only to be followed by gleeful Vistani children, much to his annoyance.

The party gathers inside their personal caravan to read from the *Tome of Strahd*. Decoding the cipher proves more complicated this time, taking longer than before. After the chapter is deciphered, the mists swirl and the vision unfolds.

The party stands, dressed as nobles, in the Great Hall at Castle Ravenloft, where the entire court is gathered. It becomes clear that months have passed since Strahd learned of his mother’s death. The court has gathered for the arrival of Strahd’s family.

 Rahadin announces the arrival of Strahd’s brother, Sergei von Zarovich. He is a strikingly handsome man with youthful features that reflect his noble heritage. He has pale, almost alabaster skin that contrasts with his dark, well-groomed hair, which falls to his shoulders in loose waves. His eyes are a deep, compelling blue, filled with an intensity and sincerity that gives him an aura of quiet strength. He carries himself with a graceful, almost regal demeanour, exuding both charm and authority. Sergei’s clothing is elegant and finely made, fitting for a man of high standing, but he wears it with a certain ease that makes him seem approachable and down-to-earth. On his hip sits a brilliant sword that seemed to absorb the sun’s rays. Despite his noble appearance, there is a warmth to him that makes others feel comfortable in his presence.

After being announced with the title of **“Awakened Sun of the Morninglord”,** Sergei salutes everyone warmly, including Strahd, and immediately goes to hug him. It looks natural for Sergei to be so open, jovial, and warm, but Strahd is visibly uncomfortable during this exchange. It is revealed that this is the first time the two brothers have met, as Strahd left home early to fight in his father’s wars.

Ziva whispers to Tian that this is the sword from Madame Eva’s prophecy. Her Tarroka card, the *Five of Stars*, mentions *“a weapon of vengeance, a sword of sunlight”.*  Ziva is convinced that Sergei’s sword is the sword mentioned in the reading.

The scene reforms, and the party finds itself in the courtyard, where a joust is prepared in honor of the arrival of Strahd’s family. The party, still dressed as nobles of the court, starts to mingle and interact with notable people.

Milos challenges Sergei to a melee, and Sergei happily accepts. Milos and Sergei, both paladins, spar fiercely with smiting strikes. The battle is intense but friendly, and Milos seems genuinely happy. It is the first time the party sees him smile as he and Sergei share a moment of mutual respect at the end while healing each other.

Tian challenges Strahd, who at first does not wish to participate. Encouraged by Sergei and put in a position where he cannot refuse in front of his whole court, Strahd accepts.

When picking his weapon, Strahd tests the balance of each sword on the rack until he finds one to his liking, informing Rahadin that the training swords are in deplorable condition and need fixing.

The melee starts, and Tian, agile and quick, manages to land a few hits, but Strahd proves to be a formidable warrior. Precise and calculated, it isn’t long before Strahd learns Tian’s fighting technique and completely anticipates his moves. Compared to Sergei, who makes his match a show, employing flamboyant technique and involving the public, Strahd is clinical, precise, and straight to the point, interested in being as efficient as possible. Strahd wins the duel, and Sergei is quick to offer encouragement and congratulations to his older brother. During their match, Ireena is distracted, as if pondering her own inner turmoil.

Next comes Sally’s duel with Dawnmaster Andral. Although at first Andral is reluctant to participate, being more interested in discussing the philosophy of Lathander the Morninglord, Sally ultimately convinces him to join the arena. The duel is marked by dramatic magic as Sally transforms into a giant snake. After a fierce exchange, in which Andral wields the radiance of the morning sun, Sally uses **Polymorph** to turn Andral into a raven, the animal on the von Zarovich coat of arms, securing her victory. The crowd erupts into applause, and Sally receives a boon—she can now cast **Mage Armor** as a ritual once per long rest.

While Tian fights Strahd, Ziva manages to get a hold of Sergei. She congratulates him on the fight with Milos, and they bond over their love for the Morninglord and chafing under the strictness and rules of noble courts. Ziva then turns the conversation to his sword, which Sergei explains has been a *“good friend”* since childhood. It is a magnificent weapon, the hilt ornate with carvings and encrusted with gems, and the blade made from a translucent crystal that captures the sun’s radiance and reflects it back. Sergei reminisces about his youth, revealing that, as a child, he was more interested in sparring and courting maidens than in the religious teachings of his mentor and good friend Andral. He expresses sadness that Strahd has become distant, but Ziva encourages him to be patient, understanding that Strahd’s burdens have shaped him.

Meanwhile, Ireena and Milos are in awe of how good it feels to be in sunlight. In this vision, they both experience it for the first time. Ireena notices Milos smiling and says she has seen him smile before, hinting at the fact that they have history together. They bond over their shared trauma at the hands of Strahd. Milos reveals his history with Strahd, recalling how the vampire lord tortured him after the failed rebellion at Castle Ravenloft, only to release him later—a cruel twist of fate that left Milos scarred.

Tian secretly listens to a conversation between Alek Gwillym and Strahd, overhearing the following exchange: Alek is preparing for an extended diplomatic mission and proposes appointing a personal guard for Strahd. Strahd, however, vehemently rejects the idea. His pride will not allow him to be seen with a personal guard, as he perceives it as a sign of weakness. Undeterred, Alek persists, speaking to Strahd in a manner that disregards their noble ranks and oversteps the boundaries of propriety. She emphasizes the need for heightened protection, at least until the culprits behind the Balverzi assassination attempt on Strahd are uncovered. Strahd rebuffs her once again, refusing the idea of a personal guard. However, he does concede to bolstering the castle’s security. Before ending the discussion, he sharply reminds Alek to mind her tone and not forget her place.

After the challenges conclude, the party gathers to discuss their experiences. Ziva shares details of her conversation with Sergei, mentioning his remark about the sword being *"a good friend"*. Tian speculates that the sword might be a sentient weapon.

Meanwhile, Milos, slightly intoxicated, jokingly asks his flail if it can talk after hearing about the potentially sentient sword. Seizing the moment, Ziva slyly casts **Thaumaturgy** to whisper in his ear, *“I have been waiting for you to notice me”*, as if it were the flail speaking. The ruse earns some laughter and lighthearted banter among the group.

The mood shifts when Milos suddenly grabs Ireena’s hand and insists on introducing her to Sergei, despite her hesitance. Concerned about Milos’s drunken impulsiveness, Ziva uses **Thaumaturgy** again, again pretending to be the voice of Milos’s flail to stop him in his tracks. The tactic works, but not before Sergei notices their approach.

Sergei and Ireena finally meet in what can only be described as a "meet-cute." Ireena’s cheeks flush as red as her hair, while Sergei seems captivated by her presence. They engage in a brief, heartfelt conversation, forming an instant connection.

Their moment is cut short by Rahadin, who interrupts to announce the next match: a duel between Strahd and Sergei. At the announcement, a fragment of memory stirs within Ireena, though its meaning remains unclear.

As the duel begins, Sergei addresses the crowd with charm, smiling and waving, his easy demeanor winning their favor. This display, however, leaves Strahd visibly uneasy, a faint glimmer of sadness flickering in his eyes as he observes his younger brother.

The fight itself is a showcase of their contrasting styles. Both are remarkably skilled, but while Sergei fights with flair and optimism, Strahd remains cold and methodical, analyzing Sergei’s moves and anticipating his strategies. Despite their equal prowess, Strahd ultimately claims victory by luring Sergei into overconfidence, cleverly using his brother’s strength and momentum against him.

After the match, Sergei beams, clearly reveling in the moment, while Strahd appears fatigued and drained. As Sergei turns to address the crowd, his words inadvertently cut sharper than intended. Strahd’s gaze snaps to him, his expression unreadable but charged with an intensity that suggests deeper emotions beneath his composed exterior.

The mists start swirling as the vision closes. Strahd’s voice echoes, bitter and resentful. He resents Sergei for being loved by the people, for his youth, strength, and charisma—qualities Strahd can never embrace.

As the vision fades, the party awakens in the Vistani caravan to the sound of forceful knocks at the door, accompanied by a commanding voice demanding that the Vistani open up and bring him a drink.

When the party opens the door, they come face to face with Escher, one of Strahd’s vampire concubines. He has platinum blond hair falling in soft waves, framing his aristocratic features. His sharp red eyes, a hallmark of his vampiric nature, gleam with both allure and danger. Escher often dresses elegantly, befitting the sophistication of Castle Ravenloft, and carries himself with an air of haughty confidence. Despite his beauty, there is a subtle predatory quality to him that hints at his true nature.

Escher reveals that he has been searching for the party and has a proposition for them. Strahd, preoccupied with Ireena of late, has been neglecting him. Resentful of this, Escher desires to see Ireena out of Strahd’s reach permanently. While he wants to kill her, he knows doing so would likely result in his own death at Strahd’s hands. Instead, he offers to assist the party in keeping Ireena away from Ravenloft. However, he warns that if they allow Ireena to go to Strahd, he will hunt them down and kill them all.

Tension rises as Escher trades insults with Sally and Milos. Sally confronts him over his rude comments about Ireena, while Escher seems to know Milos personally, leading to an antagonistic exchange. During the conversation, Escher reveals some unsettling information: Strahd intentionally lets Milos go, and Ludmilla, one of Strahd’s three brides, harbors a deep hatred for one member of the **Shards of Dawn**. However, Escher is unsure which member of the party she despises.

Before departing, Escher agrees to provide the party with information whenever he can, but only if they ensure Ireena stays far away from Ravenloft. With that, he transforms into a swarm of bats and vanishes into the night.

Milos, visibly agitated, issues a grim warning to the group: he will personally kill any of them who chooses to trust Escher or seeks his help.

Milos, watching Escher’s retreating figure, remarks that Escher offers nothing useful and is more of a liability than an asset. The party turns their attention to Milos, pressing him for details about the rebellion he joined against Strahd and why he was ultimately spared after being captured.

Milos begins recounting the grim tale. The rebellion, he explains, occurred a year ago, sparked by the vision of a wizard who, according to Milos, “wasn’t sane.” Ziva ponders whether this wizard might be the enigmatic Mad Mage who is said to hurl lightning at Lake Zarovich, a figure they have heard much about in passing.

Ireena recalls that the wizard visited her village, rallying support for his cause. Her father, the late burgomaster, had dismissed the wizard’s ambitions as “dreams of foolish children” and refused to join the rebellion. Nevertheless, the wizard’s charisma drew 15–20 villagers to his side, and together they scaled the mountain to reach Castle Ravenloft. Strahd, however, was waiting for them.

What followed was utter carnage. The rebellion was swiftly crushed—most were slaughtered on the spot, while a few, including Milos, were taken prisoner. The wizard himself was thrown from the mountain, presumably to his death.

As a captive, Milos endured unimaginable suffering: starvation, beatings, and torture. Strahd, along with Rahadin, Escher, and two of Strahd’s wives—Ludmilla and Vollenta—oversaw his torment. Strahd did something to Milos during his imprisonment. Although he had no magic before, after Strahd’s intervention, arcane power began to manifest within him. One chilling detail lingers in Milos’s memory: Strahd could walk through the very walls of his castle.

Growing visibly angry, Milos cuts off further questions, declaring the interrogation over. He wanders off to find someone to assist with repairing his scythe. An old, drunken Vistani agrees to help but falls asleep on the scythe shortly after offering his aid.

Ziva ponders on what Milos has said: people captured during the rebellion have been turned into spawns and only then released. Ziva, knowing that Milos has also been captured during the rebellion and held prisoner and then let go, begins to suspect that he might be a spawn too. Without further proof, she keeps her suspicions to herself, determined to start gathering more proof.

The party discusses their plan to infiltrate the village with Araja and Rhina. Araja shares troubling news: Izmark has taken drastic measures to “protect” the village, sending most able-bodied men to labor in the mines. He has also accused the **Shards of Dawn** of kidnapping Ireena and bringing the creatures of the night to Vallaki. With the help of a young wizard, Izmark seems determined to consolidate control.

The party crafts a plan. Milos will escort Ireena back to the village, posing as her rescuer. Ziva will disguise herself as a peasant, relying on the fact that Victor, Izmark’s son, has never seen her up close. Izek will accompany them as a guard. Meanwhile, Sally and Tian will use magic—*Shapechange* and *Polymorph*—to infiltrate the village in the guise of small animals. Izek, though thoroughly drunk, readily agrees to the plan.

Later, Sally attempts to visit Madame Eva but is turned away; the seer is sleeping. Disappointed, she inquires about Arrigal, but no one has heard from him. Araja, meanwhile, mentions a time when Wachter passed through their camp.

Elsewhere, Ireena shares childhood stories with Milos, her nostalgia tinged with an unusual amount of wine.

Milos and Ziva converse about the Morninglord. Ziva recounts her own spiritual awakening: a moment of despair transformed by witnessing a breathtaking sunrise that made her believe Lathander would guide her. Milos expresses doubt, remarking that a sunrise isn’t exactly accessible in Barovia. Ziva reassures him that faith is personal and encourages him to remain open to the possibility of finding his own moment of clarity. Tentatively, Milos tries to pray, hearing a mysterious whisper of the letter “S” in his mind.

That evening, the Vistani regale the party with tales, including a story of the Morninglord, the first human who persuaded the sun to rise again. The campfire itself seems to come alive, dancing and casting vivid shapes to accompany the narrative.

The party visits Madame Eva in her caravan, to consult with her about their journey. She confirms that Wachter once visited her, and she indeed gave her a reading, but that Wachter twisted the words of the prophecy to suit her own ends. Wachter, she reveals, has sold her skills to get to the top and is indeed forking for or with Strahd. She also reveals that Strahd lent her some of his power.

Eva warns that the reliquary Ziva and Gavin found in the Durst basement symbolizes places of power where fate can be altered. She also cautions that Strahd’s plans are nearing a pivotal moment that could forever change Barovia. Ireena, she says, is one of the many keys to the land’s fate, though Strahd foolishly believes her to be the only one.

Eva offers a choice: the party must take either Izek or Arabelle on their journey, but not both. If they attempt to bring both, one will die.

Before the party departs, Eva offers them tea, explaining it will test their resolve. As they drink, they find themselves in a dark void, each facing a shadowy doppelgänger.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ziva versus Shadow Ziva:

The battle between Ziva and her shadow self erupts in a storm of fire and fury. Both unleash devastating fireballs, their incandescent blasts colliding mid-air, scattering sparks like falling stars. Walls of fire rise and roar between them, the air thick with heat and the acrid scent of burning magic.

Ziva fights desperately, her strength waning with each spell, but she refuses to falter. Summoning every ounce of her will, she unleashes a final surge of energy, a blazing inferno that engulfs her dark counterpart. As the flames die down, Ziva stands trembling, barely upright, her breath ragged.

Dark Ziva dissolves into a swirling mist, her once-defiant demeanor softened. When she reappears, her voice is calm, almost kind. *"You can be your own person, Ziva"* she says, her tone resolute. *"But only if you have the courage to take more decisive steps."* Then, like smoke caught by the wind, she fades away.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Milos versus Shadow Milos:

The clash between Milos and his dark reflection is fierce and unrelenting. They charge at each other, blades drawn, each strike infused with divine energy meant to smite and destroy. Sparks fly as their weapons collide, the ground trembling beneath their feet. Every movement is a mirror, every blow a reflection of the other’s intent.

The fight drags on, a brutal test of strength and will, until Milos finally sees an opening. With a surge of resolve, he lands a decisive strike, radiant energy coursing through his blade as it pierces his shadow’s defenses. The force of the blow sends Dark Milos staggering, the shadows that form him flickering and unstable.

Milos doesn’t hesitate. He draws a stake, his voice steady but heavy with emotion. *“We’ve suffered enough”* he says, his words a plea as much as a declaration. With a swift motion, he plunges the stake into Dark Milos, ending the fight.

The shadow dissolves into a swirl of black mist, reforming moments later into a softer, more human shape. This time, there’s no malice in his expression. *“We don’t have to be like this”* Dark Milos says, his voice gentle, his eyes filled with understanding. He steps forward and wraps Milos in an embrace, as if to heal wounds neither of them had acknowledged before.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tian versus Shadow Tian

The two monks stand face to face, bodies poised in perfect balance, each a reflection of the other’s discipline and skill. They begin their duel with swift, precise movements, each strike aimed at the pressure points that could stun or disable their opponent. The air crackles with the energy of their combat, every blow resonating like the echo of a drumbeat.

Dark Tian moves with calculated aggression, his flurry of blows landing sharp and true. Each hit reverberates through Tian’s body, a testament to his shadow’s mastery. Yet Tian’s resolve holds firm, his focus unwavering. Timing his counterattack with practiced precision, he lands a strike that sends a surge of energy through Dark Tian’s body, leaving him momentarily immobilized.

With his opponent stunned, Tian seizes the opportunity. His strikes become a rhythm of purpose, each blow targeting critical points with deadly accuracy. The force of his attacks breaks through the shadow’s defenses, and Dark Tian’s form begins to waver.

As the final strike lands, Dark Tian dissolves into a swirling mist, his dark essence scattering into the air. The mist coalesces moments later into the figure of an older man—Tian’s uncle. The resemblance is striking, and his voice carries a weight of familiarity.

“You have the power to turn tides, Tian,” the apparition says, his tone neither accusatory nor congratulatory but filled with quiet affirmation. The words linger in the air like a lesson passed down, leaving Tian to ponder their meaning as the image fades into the void.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sally versus Shadow Sally

The battle begins with a ripple of transformation as Dark Sally assumes her signature form—a massive constrictor snake, its scales glinting with an otherworldly sheen. Sally, unflinching, calls forth her connection to nature, summoning a majestic elk that materializes with a thunderous stomp. Without hesitation, she transforms herself into an elk as well, matching power with power in a primal clash.

The two beasts collide in a frenzy of snapping jaws, striking hooves, and coiling muscles. The earth trembles beneath them as they trade devastating blows, each intent on overpowering the other. It is a battle of endurance and ferocity, the longest and most grueling fight among the party’s trials.

As the tide begins to shift, both Sally and her shadow form unleash another transformation. Their radiant soul wings unfurl, glowing with divine light, and they take to the skies, their forms alight with celestial power. The aerial battle is a dance of light and shadow, with each maneuver carefully calculated. Finally, Sally finds an opening, diving from above and striking Dark Sally with a resounding blow that sends her plummeting to the ground below.

The impact shakes the ground as Dark Sally’s form dissolves into an ethereal mist. Moments later, she reforms, her snake-like visage replaced by her human likeness, though her expression is softer, almost contemplative.

“You have much growing up to do,” she says, her voice carrying a mixture of wisdom and challenge. “We are healers, Sally—of people, of lands. There is so much good we can do, if we choose to embrace it.”

Her words linger in the air as she fades away, leaving Sally to absorb the message and the path it lays before her.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each member battles their dark counterpart, overcoming physical and emotional challenges. Victorious, they awaken in Madame Eva’s caravan, changed but unscathed. Eva informs them they have passed the trials and unlocked new gifts. These gifts, named **“Dark Gifts”** give the party some bonuses, but they will have their drawbacks.

The next morning, the party departs from the Vistani camp at Ter’s Pool towards the Village of Barovia. While they are walking, they prepare for their infiltration. Ziva shares her concerns with Izek about unresolved guilt over the burgomaster’s death, warning that Victor may exploit this weakness. Izek admits to burying his emotions for years, uncertain of his place now that the man who raised him is gone. He agrees to meditate with Ziva to strengthen his mental defenses.

Ziva also asks Milos to train her, and he agrees, setting a daily regimen at sunrise.

Near the village, Ziva casts **Clairvoyance** to spy on Izmark’s house, seeing an elf from the reformation center bent over a desk. She notes bags of rocks and crates of colorful ink. Unwittingly, she triggers an anti-scrying glyph, alerting both the wizard and Victor to their approach.

Sally transforms Tian into a bat via **Polymorph** and **Shapechanges** herself into a squirrel, hiding in Ireena’s pocket. However, with Bat Tian’s diminished intelligence, Milos is forced to carry him as a skittish, echolocating pet.

At the Village gates, Milos assumes the role of a hired escort, with Ziva in her peasant disguise. The guards recognize Ireena and reluctantly allow the group to enter. Milos intimidates them into compliance, claiming he was paid to protect Ireena and a stray peasant woman they picked up.

Inside the village, the party notes new fortifications and the wary, accusatory stares of the townsfolk. In the central square, they encounter Izmark and the elf. Izmark rushes to embrace Ireena, but his demeanor quickly shifts. He orders the guards to surround the party, accusing them of being the **Shards of Dawn** who have come to maim, pillage, and burn.

The elf begins muttering a spell, and the tension in the square grows as Ziva, Milos, and Izek are encircled by guards, while Sally and Bat Tian remain hidden.

The chaos begins with Bat Tian fighting for his life in Milos’s grasp, while Sally, disguised as a squirrel via **Shapechange**, hides in one of Ireena's pockets. Ireena stands protectively behind her brother Izmark, while Milos, Izek and Ziva are surrounded by guards. The guards, spurred on by Izmark and a wizard from the reformation center, are urged to apprehend or kill the party.

Milos, with fury in his voice, calls out to Izmark, demanding to know if this is how he treats returning villagers. He reminds Izmark of the sacrifice he made by joining the rebellion, questioning whether this is the gratitude he deserves. His words cause ripples of confusion among the villagers, though Izmark remains resolute, clinging to his stance that the party are intruders and threats. It is clear Izmark is under magical influence, his mind not his own.

Izmark hugs Ireena tightly, further isolating her, and, at the urging of the elf wizard, doubles down on his accusations. However, Milos’s impassioned speech begins to resonate, and whispers ripple through the crowd as some villagers recognize Milos as *“Laszlo’s and Marika’s boy”*. Confusion spreads; they question Izmark's orders and his treatment of Milos.

Milos, sensing the growing tension, threatens to strip anyone of their bodily autonomy should they harm the party. The standoff intensifies when the elf seizes Ireena, pressing a dagger to her throat. Milos warns the crowd that they are digging their own graves, emphasizing that Ireena is under Strahd’s protection, and any harm to her will incur Strahd's wrath. The elf, unmoved by the threat, casts **Alter Self** on Ireena, transforming her into a terrifying, bloodthirsty vampire assassin in an attempt to further manipulate the villagers.

Sally drops her **Shapechange** and lunges to disarm the elf, while Ziva attempts to **Command** him to undo the spell. Both attempts fail, and the villagers, seeing the magical displays and vampire illusion, turn against the party, convinced of Izmark's claims. Combat erupts.

Milos hurls Bat Tian at the elf. Upon impact, Tian regains his true form, takes to the air, and descends with a flurry of precise strikes. The elf crumples to the ground, unmoving, his life snuffed out. Sally dispels the illusion on Ireena and attempts to remove the magic controlling Izmark, but she fails. Izmark, dagger raised, moves to attack Ireena but falters, unable to harm his sister. Milos snaps him out of his trance with a hard slap, breaking the enchantment.

Confused and weary, Izmark is horrified by his actions over the past days but overjoyed to be reunited with Ireena. The villagers, now unsure of what to believe, murmur among themselves. Ziva, meanwhile, questions them about Victor, but the only wizard they recognize is the elf. Tian soars above the village, calling for Victor, but the elusive mage remains hidden.

The party escorts Izmark back to his and Ireena’s house, where they find crates of supplies, unrefined ink, and chalk. Once he has recovered, Izmark reveals that Victor and the elf had arrived together. He struggles to recall details, his memory hazy, but mentions that something was done to him while the two discussed their plans. Sally casts **Detect Magic**, sensing that the elf’s body is brimming with enchantment and detecting a magical source upstairs.

Sally, Tian, and Milos investigate the upstairs room. When Milos opens the door, an arcane glyph triggers, though it has no effect beyond alerting its creator. Inside, the group finds little of interest, save for a report on the mine's operations. The report reveals that the miners were coerced into digging deeper and that **“IT”** was found.

The party returns downstairs to share the information. Izmark recalls snippets of conversation between Victor and the elf. They were searching for an artifact—something capable of nullifying magic or draining it entirely. Victor insisted on its destruction, though they continued digging to conceal its discovery.

Milos sets off for the mines, his jaw clenched with a mix of determination and anger. Under the pretense of keeping watch for Victor, Ziva asks Tian to go outside with her, but before they leave, she tosses Sally the sending stone, ensuring they can remain in contact if trouble arises.

Meanwhile, Sally continues her investigation within the house. Her instincts tell her that a schemer like Victor would likely skulk in the shadows—or underground. Descending into the basement, she moves cautiously but decisively. Before her stands a locked door, a feeble barrier against her resolve. With a swift, destructive strike, she reduces the door to splinters.

From the darkness beyond, a small, skeletal cat bolts, its bony frame darting past her. The sight startles her momentarily but quickly solidifies one truth: Victor is here. The creature is unmistakable evidence of his presence.

Stepping into the room, Sally surveys the space, her keen eyes noting signs of magical experimentation. Incomplete magical circles cover the floor and walls, their patterns disrupted, as though their creator abandoned them in haste. Each fragment of the room feels like a piece of a larger, darker puzzle, further confirming the wizard’s cowardly and calculating nature.

**Shapechanged** as a giant crab, Sally scuttles through the house, her senses keen as she searches for any sign of Victor. Yet, despite her careful inspection, she detects no presence beyond the people already gathered in the house. There’s no trace of the wizard.

Shifting back into her usual form, Sally approaches Ireena. They discuss the elf’s presence, with Sally explaining that the figure radiates magic. Ireena, her expression hardening, grabs a knife from the kitchen, pressing it to the elf’s neck. Ireena commands Sally to dispel any magic left on him, her voice firm.

Sally nods and focuses, releasing the magic that cloaks the elf. The illusion dissipates, revealing not an elf at all, but a human villager named Finn—a man Izmark thought had left the village a few days prior. The realization hits them both: Finn had been kidnapped, mind-controlled by Victor, and placed under an illusion to impersonate the elf.

Izmark, stunned, murmurs that the last thing he remembers is a flash of white light while he was at his desk.  His words hang in the air, heavy with confusion and fear.

Sally, understanding the urgency of the situation, quickly reaches for the Sending Stones. She channels her message to Tian, the words clear and concise: “*The elf is still alive, and out there. Stay alert.”*

As Ziva and Tian leave under the guise of scouting for Victor, Ziva admits to Tian  that her true intent is to speak with Doru without involving the party, especially Milos. Along the way, she cuts her palm, filling her flask with blood, and heals the wound. At the church’s outskirts, Ziva uses **Message** to contact Doru. The vampire spawn, hearing her voice, assumes he is losing his sanity and pleads for judgment from the Morninglord. Ziva reassures him that she is not the voice of the Morninglord, just a person and promises they will meet soon.

Milos ventures to the mines, where he finds his father, Laszlo, stumbling drunkenly. Upon seeing Milos, Laszlo collapses into tears and tries to embrace him. Milos, seething with anger, rejects the display and chastises him for his past cruelty. Laszlo, sobbing, clings to Milos's legs, begging for forgiveness and marveling at his return.

Milos’s rage boils over as he curses his father’s drunkenness, reminding him that his son died years ago under his abuse. With a mix of disgust and pity, Milos casts **Heroism** on Laszlo, declaring that he has nothing left to fear but him. Under the spell's influence, Laszlo reveals through sobs that the miners uncovered a door deep within the tunnels.

Unconvinced, Milos drags Laszlo back to the village, his father continuing to plead for forgiveness. Milos coldly informs him that he no longer has a son, recounting the years of beatings, forced labor, and neglect. Silently, Milos prays to the Morninglord, vowing to serve Him while asking only that his mother knows he has returned.

Milos strides ahead with unrelenting determination, his grip on Laszlo firm and unyielding. The older man stumbles to keep up, his sharp glances alternating between defiance and unease as they navigate the uneven path back to the village. Behind them, a small crowd gathers, trailing at a cautious distance. Their hushed voices ripple through the air, laced with doubt and judgment.

The whispers are soft but cutting. Villagers murmur about Milos—about his supposed weakness, about how someone like him couldn’t have survived the revolution, let alone returned. Their questions hang in the air, timid yet persistent, casting a shadow over the moment.

Laszlo, unable to remain silent, finally breaks the tension. His attempts to justify himself grow increasingly frantic as they walk. He argues that he cared about Marika, his wife and about Milos. His words spill out in bursts—excuses and half-hearted reasoning for years of pain inflicted under the guise of discipline. He shifts the blame outward, claiming the drink, the circumstances, anything but himself.

But Milos remains silent, his expression carved from stone, his steady steps never faltering. His father's arguments grow sharper, an edge of self-righteousness creeping in as he clings to the tatters of his authority.

The silence shatters with a resounding slap. Milos’s hand connects with Laszlo’s face, a sharp and final punctuation to the older man’s rambling. Laszlo staggers, blood trickling from his split lip as he spits out fragments of teeth. The crowd gasps, their whispers stilled by the crack of impact.

Laszlo stares at Milos, his face twisted with a mix of bitterness and something darker. The defiance in his eyes doesn’t fade, even as he straightens and wipes the blood from his chin. His body language speaks louder than words—a bitter acknowledgment that he indeed has lost his son.

Meanwhile, back in the Village, at the church of the Morninglord, Ziva and Tian attempt to enter, but find the door sealed shut. Father Donavich has locked the church door with several heavy bolts, his fear palpable. He refuses to open it, his voice trembling as he speaks through the barrier. Ziva, calm but firm, assures him she only seeks to enter and pray. After a tense moment, Donavich relents, the sound of locks scraping against wood echoing as he opens the door.

His relief turns to panic when he catches sight of Tian, whom he recognizes from the last time he was in the Village, standing nearby. With a strangled cry, Donavich slams the door shut again, frantically bolting it once more. Ziva, undeterred, speaks through the door, invoking her faith and claiming that she walks in the Morninglord’s light. Her sincerity cuts through his fear, and, after a moment’s hesitation, Donavich agrees to let her in—but only her. Tian must remain outside.

As Ziva steps toward the door, a shadow looms in her mind. Shar’s voice rises within her, demanding recognition. The dark deity’s presence presses heavily against Ziva’s spirit, her will tested under the strain. Ziva refuses to yield, holding fast to her devotion to the Morninglord. The tension swells until it is shattered by the thunderous voice of Lathander, booming a single command: ***Enough***. The oppressive presence vanishes, and Ziva steps through the now-open door.

Inside, the church is a shadow of its former sanctity. Chaos and neglect mar the holy space—wax drips over the altar in disarray, the air thick with despair. Meanwhile, Tian takes to the air outside, circling until he spots an open window, ready to act if Ziva needs him.

Ziva approaches Donavich, his gaunt face pale and lined with worry. She asks why he has barricaded himself inside. The priest, his voice trembling, explains that Izmark had ordered him to the mines under threat of death. Fearing for Doru, Donavich refused and locked himself inside the church instead. His voice breaks as he confesses his doubts, wondering aloud if the Morninglord has abandoned them.

Ziva places a reassuring hand on his shoulder, her words steady and resolute. She assures him that the Morninglord has not forsaken Barovia, that His light is striving to break through the darkness.

As her words linger in the air, Tian receives Sally's urgent message about the elf. Ziva, sensing the opportunity, improvises. She tells Donavich that they are searching for Victor, a dangerous wizard known to hide in basements. To create an opening, she asks Tian to cause a distraction.

Tian swoops down and begins pounding on the church door, his voice rising in exaggerated concern. He rambles about Victor, the mines, and everything in between, pulling Donavich's attention away. The priest hesitates, clearly torn between listening to the racket outside and staying with Ziva.

In the confusion, Ziva seizes her chance. She darts into a side room and, with a whispered incantation, Misty Steps into the basement.

As soon as Ziva’s form reappears in the basement, Doru immediately lunges at her, but she swiftly sidesteps his attack, her presence imposing enough to make him hesitate. His aggression falters under her gaze, and he reluctantly pulls back. Ziva, undeterred, begins her questioning, probing Doru about his time at Castle Ravenloft, the rebellion, and Milos. She is interested if Doru might also confirm her suspicions that Milos might be a spawn, just like him, seeing as they endured similar punishments at castle Ravenloft.

Doru recounts the horrors that followed their capture. Initially, they were thrown into cages, left to starve until they were mere shadows of themselves. Once the starvation had almost killed them, the true torment began—beatings, tortures, and unrelenting cruelty. Milos had fought back once, a defiant act that caught Strahd’s attention.

Strahd took Milos, and no one else, from the cage that day. When He returned, He proclaimed that He had found what He was seeking. The rest of the prisoners, stripped of their will, were turned into spawns of Strahd and set free to do His bidding.

Doru speaks with reluctant admiration, revealing that Milos was always at the forefront, leading them with strength and determination. He was the reason many of them had joined the rebellion in the first place.

Ziva, having heard enough, tosses Doru a flask of blood, then vanishes in a Misty Step, reappearing in the church where Father Donavich is still struggling to keep Tian at bay outside. She briefly thanks him, assuring him that the wizard isn’t there, and without another word, she and Tian leave, heading back toward the burgomaster’s house.

Ziva and Tian arrive back at Ireena’s house just moments before Milos and his father. As they settle in, the interrogation of Laszlo begins. The conversation quickly turns to the findings in the mines. Laszlo recounts how they discovered a door, and the elf had instructed him to bring the men to the site. There, they found something resembling a mirror. When Laszlo tried to touch it, the surface was solid, unyielding. Both Victor and the elf arrived shortly after and ordered him to cover it with dirt. To ensure their secret was kept, Victor cast some sort of magic on the men, causing them to forget. Laszlo himself was not spared; he was made to feel overwhelming fear and pain. The elf and Victor threatened him, warning that if he told anyone, they would kill him—and they would find Marika. They had discovered the mirror six days ago.

Laszlo tries once more to explain his actions to Milos, claiming the beatings were meant to teach him. Milos, however, has heard enough. He orders Laszlo out of the house, which Laszlo reluctantly obeys.

Once Laszlo has gone, Milos pulls Ziva aside, asking her to contact his mother. Describing her to Ziva, he hopes for some sign of Marika’s whereabouts. Ziva attempts a **Sending** spell and manages to make contact. Marika’s voice responds, but her words are confused. She speaks of seeing beautiful images by the lake and of joining *“Isti”* mistakenly assuming Ziva is the Morninglord. Ziva continues sending messages, slowly convincing Marika that Milos is indeed alive and waiting for her. She learns that Marika is near the base of the mountain, by the lake. She is cold, weak, and near death. Milos, heart sinking, realizes his mother must have gone there in search of the Mad Mage.

Suddenly, Milos experiences a vision, granted by the Morninglord. Without a word, he bolts from the house, running toward the church, with Ziva and Izek close behind.

Inside the house, Ireena begins to speak with Sally and Tian of her past with Milos. They had known each other since childhood, playing together as kids. She recalls how different Milos was back then, how little he ever spoke of his life at home. Everything changed when the revolution began, and Milos was among the first to sign up. After his departure, Laszlo’s drinking worsened. Father Donavich, she says, mentioned that Laszlo began attending church every day to pray.

Afterwards, Sally goes to another room and attempts to meditate, seeking to reach her father. She confesses that he couldn’t save her mother, but she hopes he might hear her plea to save Milos’s mother. At first, there is only silence, but soon a cacophony of whispers fills the room. From the midst of the voices, a woman’s voice emerges more clearly. She tells Sally that her father cannot be reached, but *they* can—and they are waiting.

As Milos, Izek, and Ziva approach the church, they hear manic laughter spilling from inside. The door is shut and locked, but Ziva, sensing the urgency, urges Izek and Milos to break it down. With a forceful shove, the door splinters, crashing open.

Inside, they find Father Donavich lying near the trapdoor, crying, his hands trembling as he attempts to calm his son. Doru, having been fed blood by Ziva, is in a frenzy, thrashing against his confinement with newfound strength. Milos steps forward, trying to press down on the hatch to keep Doru contained. But with a surge of power, Doru breaks free, and a confrontation looms.

Milos, however, is quick to act. Dark smoke begins to pour from his eyes, enveloping Doru in a shadowy mist. Doru, unable to resist, falters as Milos uses his *Channel Divinity* to cast **Control Undead**, binding Doru under his command for the next 24 hours.

Under Milos’s control, Doru falls still, his manic energy subsiding. He begins to speak, his voice filled with confusion and pain. He repeatedly asks Milos how he survived, how he’s still alive after all this time. Father Donavich, broken and sobbing, tries in vain to lash out at Milos, blaming him for Doru’s fate. He insists that Milos’s rebellion had been the catalyst for everything that went wrong, that it was his fault Doru had joined in the first place.

Milos meets Doru’s eyes, and in that moment, the undead creature pleads for death. Without hesitation, Milos retrieves a wooden stake and drives it through Doru’s heart. The sound of the stake hitting its mark echoes in the church, and Doru falls to the ground, lifeless once more.

Father Donavich collapses, sobbing uncontrollably. He attempts to strike Milos, but his grief-stricken efforts are futile. The others try to console him, explaining that this was the only way to end Doru’s torment, that he had died long ago on that mountain. But Donavich’s grief consumes him, and he screams at them, accusing them of not understanding the agony of losing a child.

Milos, conflicted but resolute, offers to perform the funeral rites, to honor Doru’s passing with a **Ceremony**. But Father Donavich, in his anguish, refuses, insisting that he will bury his son alone.

As they leave the church, Milos speaks quietly to Ziva and Izek, recounting the vision Lathander sent him of the church. He tells them that Lathander had spoken to him as well, assuring him that he would keep Marika alive until Milos could reach her.

Back at the Burgomaster’s house, the weight of his actions finally overwhelms Milos. He retreats into a quiet corner, unable to hold back the flood of emotions that had been building within him for so long. His shoulders shake as he succumbs to the guilt and pain that had festered inside him.

After a few moments, he gathers himself and asks to speak with Ireena privately. The two of them move to a quieter space, away from the others. Milos begins by confessing the burden he’s been carrying. Ireena listens intently, her expression softening as he speaks.

She shares her own memories of Laszlo, revealing how his behavior deteriorated after Marika left. He had always struggled with his demons, but after her departure, the drinking escalated. Still, he had found some solace in visiting the church every day.

Milos listens, his heart heavy. He admits that his anger had been the only thing that kept him going for so long, a way to focus his pain and frustration. But Ireena gently tells him that people can change, though it isn’t something that can be done alone.

Milos nods, his voice trembling as he reflects on his past. He acknowledges that, before the drinking, Laszlo hadn’t been a bad father. It was different when he was a child, and there had been moments of tenderness between them. But the rage and the alcohol had driven a wedge between them, one that Milos had never been able to overcome.

He also admits that this past year has changed him. He’s done things he’s not proud of, and in the process, he’s become something he despises—a monster. But despite everything, Milos vows that he will do whatever it takes to make things right, even if it means becoming a tool for Lathander’s will.

Ireena looks at him with a mixture of sympathy and strength. She shares her own struggles, revealing that she, too, is a tool of fate—one that has often been cruel and unforgiving. But she doesn’t care about that anymore. What matters is taking control of her own fate, and Milos must do the same.

Overcome with emotion, Milos breaks down, tears flowing freely. Ireena steps forward and envelops him in a comforting embrace. In that moment, the weight of the world seems to lift, if only for a brief moment. She whispers softly, assuring him that they will help each other become better—one step at a time.

At the Burgomaster's house, while the party rests, Ireena and Izmark catch up. Ireena shares the details of our journey so far, though she carefully omits the secret of being the key to the curse and Tatyana’s reincarnation. As the conversation shifts to our next course of action, the party agrees that digging up whatever Victor and the elf had buried is our priority.

Izmark, however, expresses concern about being left alone. He fears falling prey to Victor’s mind control again. Izek steps forward, offering to stay behind and protect Izmark. Milos, in turn, hands Izek his ring of **Mind Shielding** to ensure he is less susceptible to the wizard’s influence. He also leaves his shadow behind, creating the illusion that Izmark is better protected than he really is.

As the **Shards of Dawn** make their way through the village, the Vistani they pass by give the party strange, assessing looks, but the party pushes on towards Milos’s house to gather the necessary mining tools. There, the party is greeted by a very drunk Laszlo, who demands to know how the party plans to find what they’re looking for without his help. Milos, tired of dealing with his father, uses magic to cure Laszlo’s drunkenness, an action that infuriates him even more. Laszlo starts to berate Milos, accusing him of being more obedient before meeting Ireena, and blaming her for Milos’s desire to leave and forge his own path. He mentions rumors that Milos was planning to leave with a witch, an idea he claims to have “*saved*” Milos from.

Ziva, curious, asks about the witch, but Milos remains evasive. Ziva, now able to read Milos more easily than before, notices something amiss in his demeanor. She doesn't push further, and they continue their journey, leaving Laszlo behind.

On the road to the mines, Tian approaches Milos, asking if he really intends to kill Laszlo. Milos admits that he had wanted to do so before arriving in the village, but now, after everything that’s happened, he’s not so sure. He confesses that anger has always been a part of him, and he’s unsure of who he’d be without it. Tian presses him, questioning whether he plans to leave his anger behind as well. Milos doesn’t have an answer, unsure if he even can.

Ireena, overhearing their exchange, asks Milos if the rumors about his family are true. Milos, confused, has no knowledge of the rumors she speaks of—that the Milosovich family is cursed and that two of Milos’s siblings had died before he was born. Milos resolves to ask Laszlo about it when he can.

At the mine, Sally casts **Detect Magic** to search for any arcane traps or hidden glyphs, but finds nothing of note. The party briefly discusses resurrecting Bray with Jenny’s help but quickly dismisses the idea, realizing the time frame for a successful resurrection has passed, and without Bray’s body, the chances are slim.

Ziva asks Milos to carve her a sun symbol to later coat in gold, which will be necessary for her **Divination** spell. Sally is the first to venture into the mine, followed by Milos, while Ziva, holding a light source, walks in the middle, with Ireena and Tian trailing behind. Ireena crafts a string of bells to act as an alarm in case they’re followed.

Inside, Ziva and Ireena are spooked by the rats and spiders, the claustrophobic space unsettling Ziva more than she lets on. Sally’s **Detect Magic** pings off, and Milos begins digging. It isn’t long before they uncover a rectangular door-like object that shimmers like a mirror, framed in intricate gold.

Sally throws a flower at it, watching as it briefly merges with the door before falling away. Milos reaches out to touch it, and his hand sinks into the surface, only to be pushed back. Tian steps up with a sudden realization and begins walking backwards toward the mirror. As he approaches, he vanishes into it.

Ziva attempts to cast a **Message** to Tian, but he’s unreachable. Without hesitation, Sally jumps in after him, followed by Milos. Ziva, alarmed, questions their sanity, but Ireena, agreeing that they are completely mad, charges into the mirror as well. Reluctantly, Ziva follows.

Inside, the party finds themselves in a circular room, and the mirror appears to work only one way—there’s no returning through it. As they explore, they discover ancient stone coffins, their remains long turned to dust. The silence of the crypt is oppressive, and no sound can be heard, even as they move through it.

The crypt leads to a corridor that opens into an even larger chamber, its immense pillars stretching upwards. Milos, eager to investigate further, attaches a torch to a javelin and throws it, illuminating the vast room. In the distance, two massive figures stand, eerily still, like sentinels. They remind the party of the revenants they encountered at the abandoned churches.

As the javelin passes through one revenant’s shoulder, their attention snaps to us. The javelin continues its arc and embeds itself into the back wall, which also appears to be part of the crypt. Suddenly, the room is filled with screeching and hissing—vampire spawns, closing in on the party.

A battle erupts. The revenants immediately focus on Milos and Sally, declaring them as the ones that reek of vengeance. Meanwhile, four gaunt, ancient vampire spawns leap from the shadows, attacking the party relentlessly.

Ziva uses her *Channel Divinity* to **Turn Undead**, sending three of the spawns fleeing, but one manages to resist the effect and sinks its teeth into her. Milos, already battered by the revenant’s attacks, struggles to defend himself. Sally is paralyzed by the male revenant, enduring brutal blows, but Tian comes to her aid, distracting the revenant long enough for Sally to transform into a giant constrictor snake, crushing one of the spawns.

Ziva, remembering that undead heal unless struck by fire or radiant damage, shouts this revelation to the group and channels the **Radiance of Dawn** through another *Channel Divinity*. The undead recoil, but the two revenants remain—still elusive, almost intangible. And with the three spawns returning soon, the fight is far from over.

Revenants ambush Ireena, their voices dripping with malice as they claim to smell vengeance radiating from her. They say she has craved revenge for ages. “For many lifetimes, it has gathered.” they sneer. Without hesitation, they attack her mercilessly. The party scrambles to defend her, doing everything possible to keep her alive.

One of the revenants strikes a devastating blow, felling Ireena and lifting her limp body by the throat. Before it can do further harm, Tian intervenes, pulling her away from the revenant's grasp. Ziva quickly casts a spell to bring Ireena back to consciousness, though she remains weak and shaken.

Meanwhile, Milos and Sally focus their attacks on the other revenant, managing to bring it down. As it falls, the revenant hisses a chilling vow: “You cannot truly kill me. I will not rest until vengeance is ours.”

The remaining revenant turns its attention back to Ireena, its voice venomous. “You are the reason the **Dark Powers** were called to this land,” it declares. “You are the key. Because of you, *the Usurper* sought the vestiges of darkness. For centuries, they were contained, but your soul destroyed everything. Because of you, **Vampyr** was unleashed upon this land.”

Ireena, though conscious, feels a deep spiritual cold, the damage she has taken far more than physical. Before she can react, the revenant strikes her again, rendering her unconscious once more. It raises her body and hurls her toward the wall with brutal force.

Milos reacts with unnatural speed, running up the wall and catching Ireena before she collides with it. The party, stunned by his display, says nothing, even as Milos remains perched on the wall. Ziva rushes to the base and casts **Healing Word** on Ireena, reviving her again. Milos descends carefully, placing Ireena on the ground before sprinting back to the revenant.

This time, the party notices something different. Milos’s face is elongated, his eyes gleaming a crimson hue, and long fangs protrude from his mouth. **Milos is a vampire**.

The party watches in shock as Milos tears through the remaining revenant with horrifying efficiency before turning his attention to the vampire spawns clawing at the crypt’s back walls. When he returns, he is drenched in blood.

The revelation stuns the group, though their reactions vary. Ziva, smug, high-fives herself, proud to have suspected this all along. Tian simply accepts Milos and shakes his hand, while Sallyanne seems indifferent. Only Ireena reacts with appropriate outrage, trembling as she draws her rapier.

Milos admits, voice heavy with regret, that Strahd made him what he is. Ireena’s hand trembles as her blade grazes his skin, drawing blood. Her fury boils over, but she cannot bring herself to strike him down. Instead, she screams at him and storms off, Sally following close behind.

The initial shock of Milos’s transformation fades as the party begins exploring the crypt. The chamber reveals itself to be a vast vestige hall for the dead, its intricate honeycomb pattern of sarcophagi stretching into the darkness.

Tian rummages through the remains, uncovering trinkets worth 120 gold pieces, while Ziva collects macabre trophies—a mummified head from an ancient corpse and the heads of the three slain vampire spawns.

Through another door, the party finds an ancient, decrepit study. The air is thick with the scent of decay, and disintegrated books line the walls, their pages long unreadable. A writing desk sits in the center, surrounded by 17 shrines, each with a metal plaque inscribed in Strahd’s handwriting. Upon further investigation Ziva manages to decipher the writings on each of the altars:

* **Vecna, the God of Secrets** → The gift of evil  
* **Vampyr, the Undying** → The gift of immortality, *My Bane*  
* **Tenebrous, the Knowledgeable** → The gift of lichdom *Khazan*  
* **Zhudun, the Corpse Star** → The gift of raising the ancient dead. *I think Khazimir was looking to find this but failed.*  
* **Fekre, the Queen of Poxes** → The gift of disease. *I have read that this was also gained by Negnal.*  
* **Zrin-Hala, the Howling Storm** → The gift of lightning. *I presume this was acquired by Negnal.*  
* **Sykane, the Soul Hungerer** → The gift of raising the recently deceased  
* **Savnok, the Inscrutable** → The gift of mind shielding  
* **Tarakamedes, the Grave Wyrm** → The gift of flight  
* **Shami-Amourae, the Lady of Delights** → The gift of persuasion  
* **Drizlash, the Nine-Eyed Spider** → The gift of wall-walking  
* **Dahlver-Nar, He of Many Teeth** → The gift of many lives  
* **Zantras, the Kingmaker** → The gift of presence and personality  
* **Delban, the Star of Ice** → The gift of deadly cold  
* **Khirad, the Star of Secrets** → The gift of divination  
* **Yrrga, the Eye of Shadows** → The gift of true sight  
* **Great Taar Haak, the Five-Headed Destroyer** → The gift of great strength  
* **Yog, the Invincible** → The gift of resilience  
* **Norganas, the Finger of Oblivion** → The gift of creating undeath  
* **Vaund, the Evasive** → The gift of evasion  
* **Seriach, the Hellhound Whisperer** → The gift of beasts

These are the **Vestiges of the Dark Powers**.

The next room illuminates as the party steps inside, magical torches casting an eerie glow. At its center stands a massive altar, surrounded by smaller altars, each bearing themes of *Blood*, *Darkness*, *Death*, and *Eternal Night*.

The central altar depicts gruesome scenes of vampiric rituals and sacrifices. At its core lies a single blood-red stone, pulsating with magic. When Sally approaches, whispers fill her mind, detailing rituals tied to human sacrifice, commanding armies, and more:

* *Elixir of Eternity*  
* *Veil of Shadows*  
* *Bloodmoon Rite*  
* *Night’s Embrace*

Ziva traces the lines on the *Blood* altar, only for a sharp edge to cut her finger. Her blood swirls in the altar's intricate patterns before vanishing, absorbed into the stone. The room falls silent, the magic palpable and ominous.

The party continues inspecting the altars, their presence heavy with latent energy. After a time, Strahd’s voice fills the chamber, resonating with a grim authority. He declares this place to be a fragment of his past, a monument to his struggles. Only those who truly understand the trials he endured can unseal its mysteries.

Ireena, after careful observation, concludes that the altars symbolize metaphorical sacrifices and battles—tokens of pivotal moments in Strahd’s life. With this revelation, the party reexamines the altars, their significance shifting under this new understanding. Each altar reveals a clue tied to Strahd’s sacrifices:

* **Eternal Night**: Accepting the darkness within.  
* **Darkness**: Regret → *“Regret is no mystery to me. I was robbed of my youth, my childhood. I had to do what was right.”*  
* **Blood**: The unavoidable spilling of blood. → *“I have seen and tasted more blood than any man should. Blood drawn in honorable combat was an outcome I did not wish for.”*  
* **Death**: Sacrifice, both metaphorical and spiritual. → *“I have died more times than I care to admit. Part of me I had to kill to achieve what was needed. I sacrificed many things to do what I knew to be right.”*

One by one, the party members approach the altars, each drawn to those that resonate with their own lives.

**Milos**

At the **Altar of Darkness**, Milos reflects on the lives he has taken without reason, the regret of his actions weighing heavily. He accepts that this burden will remain with him forever.

At the **Altar of Eternal Night**, he acknowledges that becoming a vampire was not his choice, but it is now an unchangeable part of him, one he must learn to live with.

At the **Altar of Blood**, Ireena confronts Milos, stating that this altar demands blood. Drawing her rapier, she challenges him to combat. Milos accepts, retrieving a sword from Tian. The two face off, their blows landing minor wounds, and their blood flows into the altar, pooling at its base as a testament to their battle. During the duel, Ireena uses a childhood maneuver to outwit Milos. He recognizes it immediately, recalling how he fell for it countless times in their youth. Despite the determination in her expression, Ireena’s smile betrays a hint of enjoyment.

**Ziva**

At the **Altar of Death**, Ziva repeats Strahd’s words, admitting that in the Tome of Strahd, she sacrificed her convictions for a chance at life. She remains uncertain if it was the right decision, but it is one she must live with.

At the **Altar of Eternal Night**, Ziva places her left hand, marked with Shar’s holy symbol, on the altar. She acknowledges a darkness within herself—a love for wielding justice on her terms, even when it skirts cruelty. She admits she enjoys the power and the thrill it brings, despite knowing she should not.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tian**

At the **Altar of Darkness**, Tian reveals the blood of an entire town stains his hands, a regret that haunts him deeply.

At the **Altar of Death**, he reflects on how his emotions have led to the deaths of innocents. Determined to prevent this in the future, he resolves to temper his judgment and not let his emotions control him.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sally**

At the **Altar of Eternal Night**, Sally removes her shoulder armor, exposing the dark scar left by Shar. The scar serves as a constant reminder of the goddess’s attack that took her mother and tribe, leaving a mark not only on her body but on her soul.

At the **Altar of Death**, Sally reflects on how her pursuit of vengeance forced her to sacrifice her youth and childhood.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As each party member reveals their truths, Strahd’s voice addresses them, offering his perspective on their emotions and sacrifices. With each revelation, the altars crack and crumble, their power weakening until they are completely destroyed. The energy they held converges into the **Bloodstone** crystal on the central altar. The crystal floats toward the door, its energy transforming the barrier into a bleeding surface. A mirror, similar to the one encountered earlier, materializes before the door.

Milos grabs the floating **Bloodstone**, sensing its primal and ancient magic. Sally takes it briefly, feeling its ability to alter magic—amplifying, diminishing, or even erasing it. The stone’s magic contrasts sharply with the arcane energies of the land. Ziva places the **Bloodstone** into her Bag of Holding, and the party moves on.

The party emerges into a crypt corridor, though something feels off. This space seems newer, less weathered by time. Milos moves along the ceiling, casting **Detect Magic**. He is immediately blinded, overwhelmed by the presence of powerful illusion magic.

Ziva narrows her eyes and discerns the truth. The corridor is not a crypt at all but an illusion masking the limestone mines of the Village of Barovia. She shares this realization with the party just as 15 skeletal figures armed with swords approach.

The battle begins. Sally transforms into a sabertooth tiger, tearing into one of the skeletons. However, the sensation is wrong—it doesn’t feel like biting through bone. Unable to communicate in her beast form, she stops attacking and sprints toward the end of the corridor, where another crypt-like chamber awaits.

Tian and Ireena dispatch several skeletons. Meanwhile, Milos detects the scent of blood during the fight and shouts that something is amiss. Ziva casts her gaze through the illusion magic and realizes the truth: these are not skeletons but miners and villagers under mind control, likely by Victor.

As the battle rages, Tian feels a sinister force attempting to invade his mind. He steadies himself at the last moment, resisting the attack. Almost simultaneously, both Tian and Ziva shout a warning: Victor is here.

Sally, still in her saber-toothed tiger form, advances cautiously into a circular room illuminated by flickering lights. The space mirrors the crypt the party has encountered before, with torches lining the walls and an altar that seems perfectly designed to hold the Bloodstone. She scans the room for movement, finding it eerily empty, and relies on her heightened senses to pick up any unusual scents. Her keen nose identifies three human-like presences and something else—an ominous, inhuman smell that sets her on edge.

As the rest of the party follows, Ireena urges Ziva to use the **Bloodstone** on the altar to banish Victor. Ziva, unwilling to reveal that the **Bloodstone** rests securely in her Bag of Holding, feigns confusion and advances toward the chamber. Frustrated by Ziva’s refusal, Ireena seizes the Bag of Holding without Ziva noticing.

Tian witnesses this and immediately warns the group, suspecting Ireena is under Victor’s control. He moves to attack her, aiming to wound her slightly and break the hold of Victor’s influence. Simultaneously, Ziva lunges to reclaim her Bag. Ireena deftly avoids both, realizing she is cornered. In desperation, she upends the Bag of Holding, spilling its contents onto the floor, including the **Tome of Strahd.**

Tiger Sally, returning from the altar room, sees the chaotic scene unfold. With quick reflexes, she snatches the **Bloodstone** in her mouth for safekeeping. A skeletal cat leaps from the shadows and explodes upon her, but Tiger Sally endures the damage and refuses to relinquish the stone.

Milos grabs the **Tome of Strahd**, securing it in his own Bag of Holding. As he does, he throws a javelin into the circular room, striking an invisible entity. Tian charges into the room, preparing for battle, with Milos close behind. Ziva kneels among the scattered items, hurriedly collecting her spell components. Tiger Sally approaches her and drops the **Bloodstone** into the Bag once more.

As the **Bloodstone** is secured, the illusions shrouding the room dissolve. The circular altar room is revealed to be a crude mess hall for the miners. The elf from the Reformation Center and Victor stand at its center. The elf, enraged, berates the party, claiming they cannot comprehend the artifact's power or significance. Victor, seated in deep concentration, chants an incantation, summoning three colossal skeletal figures to aid in their fight.

Victor’s control over Ireena is broken, and she awakens, horrified by her actions. The elf, his anger boiling over, shouts, *“Fine, then die here\!”* and unleashes a spell aimed at the mine’s ceiling. Rocks crash down toward Sally, Ireena, and Ziva. Sally and Ireena leap out of harm’s way, but Ziva, crouched and distracted by her gathering of her spell components from the floor, is buried beneath the rubble.

Tian and Milos waste no time. Tian closes the distance to the elf, striking with a flurry of brutal attacks. Milos charges at Victor, delivering a smite that breaks his concentration and causes the skeletal figures to vanish. He follows this with a devastating bite, leaving Victor barely standing.

Victor, now desperate, begs for his life, offering to share his knowledge with the party. He insists he is not their enemy and only seeks to leave this cursed land, believing the **Bloodstone** to be the key. Milos silences him with a swift blow, knocking him unconscious.

Meanwhile, the elf retreats, attempting to cast another spell. Tian intercepts him, unleashing a relentless assault that breaks multiple bones. As the elf collapses, he pleads for mercy, revealing the artifact’s true name: ***The Soul Crystal of the Dark Powers***. He claims he can explain its nature and insists his alliance with Victor was born of necessity. He offers his knowledge in exchange for his life, but Tian, cold and resolute, rejects the plea. “Your terms are not acceptable” he declares before ending the elf's life.

Back in the corridor, Sally and Ireena struggle to clear the rubble trapping Ziva, who remains unresponsive beneath the rocks. Their efforts are in vain as the debris proves too massive to move. Hearing their cries, Milos rushes to help. Together, they manage to expose Ziva’s upper body, but Milos quickly realizes she is no longer breathing.

Overcome with grief, Milos drops to his knees and offers a desperate prayer to Lathander, pleading for Ziva’s life. He offers his vampiric powers in exchange, willing to sacrifice himself to save her. A tremor runs through his soul, and the voice of the Morninglord answers: *“I can help, but life is a fickle thing. I cannot hold two strands at the same time. I must release one. Which will it be?”*

Milos understands the choice before him: the Morninglord cannot sustain both Ziva and his mother. He reflects on his mother, harboring resentment for her actions yet knowing her heart would shatter to see him fall. Resolving to end her suffering and preserve Ziva’s life, he chooses to let his mother go.

Radiant tears fall from Milos’s eyes, their light seeping into Ziva’s body. Slowly, she stirs, revived by the divine energy. The rest of the party watches in awe, unaware of the silent, agonizing decision Milos has made.

Milos, Ireena, and Sally labor to free a barely breathing Ziva from the rubble. As Milos administers a healing potion, memories from his past life stir within him. The potion takes effect, and Ziva awakens in excruciating pain. Realizing her body is pinned, panic overtakes her, and she claws at the debris in desperation. Milos urges her to remain calm, assuring her that every effort is being made to extract her safely.

Ziva gathers herself and instructs the party to step back. Channeling her magic, she casts **Misty Step** and teleports out of the rubble, avoiding further destabilizing the mine. However, her injuries are severe—multiple broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder, a swollen wrist, and a right leg shattered in three places. She cannot feel the leg at all. Milos carefully sets the bones in her arm and leg to ensure proper healing, while Sally stabilizes the mine's structure with **Entangle**.

The voices of approaching figures echo through the tunnel. Izek and a small group of men emerge, bringing news of a struggle outside. Milos takes the opportunity to hogtie Victor, ensuring the sorcerer cannot escape. Meanwhile, Ireena tends to Ziva's wounds, preparing a makeshift sedative mixed with herbs to ease her pain. Ziva drifts into a fitful sleep.

Izek explains that outside the mine, villagers attempted to breach the entrance to aid Victor. He and his men intervened just in time, finding Milos’s father and another villager already holding the door. Milos and Sally recover scattered belongings from Ziva’s Bag of Holding, though several items are lost to the rubble, including valuable potions. Sally also tends to the unconscious miners, while Tian notes a freshly drawn teleportation circle in the chamber. With Ziva unconscious and stabilized, Izek carries her, and the group heads out of the mine.

The party exits to find Izmark barely standing, wounded and out of breath. Nearby, Laszlo clutches his side, his life clearly hanging by a thread. Milos rushes to him, administering a healing potion and bandaging his wounds. Sally assists Izmark and other villagers who sustained injuries during the confrontation.

A grieving villager confronts the party, blaming them for his son’s death within the mine. Izmark intervenes, announcing that a village meeting will be held the following day to address recent events.

As the group travels back, Izmark speaks privately with Ireena, sharing that since her departure, Strahd has ceased his attacks on the village. Ireena, reluctant to reveal her true identity, attributes Strahd’s focus to the party’s actions. Izmark presses her to abandon the group and return home, but Ireena deflects, insisting her journey is far more complicated than he understands.

Milos is approached by Bildrath, who promises to care for Laszlo when Milos departs. Bildrath also reveals that Laszlo, despite his flaws, harbored genuine love for Milos. When asked about Milos’s siblings, Bildrath confirms they all died before Milos was born, making him technically an only child.

The party arrives back at the burgomaster’s house. Victor is secured in the basement alongside the elf’s corpse. Ziva, still under the influence of Ireena’s sedative, is placed in a room upstairs. As the party discusses the events in the mine, a knock at the door interrupts them. Izmark answers to find a villager reporting a grim discovery—Father Donavich has hanged himself in the church. Izmark directs the villagers to recover the body, while Ireena departs to assist the wounded.

Sally tends to Ziva’s injuries, carefully bandaging her wounds and applying healing herbs. Seizing the moment, she takes Ziva’s left hand and addresses Shar, demanding answers about the goddess’s connection to Ziva. The tattoo on Ziva’s hand heats up as Shar’s voice resonates in Sally’s mind.

Shar cryptically reveals that Ziva once asked for something, and Shar granted it. She reflects on her lack of interest in Sally years ago but notes that Sally now piqued her curiosity. Shar taunts Sally with details of her past, including the death of her mother, whom Shar killed out of spite for a broken deal between her and Sally’s father. Sally declares that she might have helped Shar under different circumstances, but Shar dismisses the notion, declaring Sally irrelevant for now. The tattoo cools, ending the exchange.

Ziva awakens to find Sally tending to her. Fear floods her expression, and she begins to cry, asking Sally to leave. Milos enters, administering another healing potion without a word before departing for the church. Sally quietly leaves Ziva alone, who falls unconscious once more.

At the church, Father Donavich’s body still swings from his noose as Ireena tends to the injured with focused determination. Milos searches for his father but finds him absent. Kneeling at the altar, Milos offers thanks to Lathander for saving Ziva. Later, he discovers Laszlo in the cemetery and informs him of Marika’s fate, revealed to him by the Morninglord.

Laszlo, moved by the revelation, vows to retrieve Marika, unwilling to remain alone in the world. Reflecting on how the hatred he saw in Milos’ eyes broke Victor’s mind control over him, Laszlo imparts a final message: *“You, whoever you are, tell my son to be better than me.”*

Milos climbs to the church rooftop, gazing at Strahd’s distant castle. Overwhelmed, he whispers, *“Why me?”* and drifts into sleep beneath the stars.

The next morning, Milos returns in time to see Tian landing outside. Tian claims he has been searching for ravens, but Milos senses deception and voices his doubts. Afterward, Milos checks on Victor in the basement, finding him restrained and visibly struggling.

The party gathers to plan their next move. Ziva, now reliant on a crutch, apologizes to Sally for her earlier outburst and thanks her for her care. When discussing Victor, Ziva proposes a plan: she will interrogate him with Milos while Sally, in animal form, observes unseen.

Before confronting Victor, Ziva requests the elf’s corpse. Alone in a room, she casts **Animate Dead**, imbuing the body with a mockery of life. The elf rises as a zombie under her control.

Ziva and Milos confront Victor, with Sally observing in her rat form. Victor, blindfolded and terrified, struggles against his bonds. Ziva lays out his choices, demanding all information about the **Bloodstone** and anything else of value that might spare his life. She heightens his fear, threatening to bind his soul to eternal servitude.

Leaving Victor to compose his thoughts, Ziva summons the zombie elf as a grotesque companion to intimidate him further. To cement her threat, she commands the zombie to tear off its own ears. Milos strings the ears onto a necklace alongside those of his siblings and places it around Victor’s neck as a grim reminder of his fate.

With Victor visibly shaken, Ziva and Milos exit, leaving Sally behind in rat form to watch for any signs of treachery.

After the conversation with Victor concludes, Milos and Ziva ascend the stairs back to the main room. Milos notices that Tian’s plumage appears cleaner, and though he seems weary, he is unusually well-kept. Milos informs Ziva of Tian’s suspicious behavior the previous night, pointing out that he has been evasive about his whereabouts. Ziva decides she will speak with Tian herself.

Once Victor has been left to dwell on his situation, Milos assists Ziva back to the basement for another interrogation. Sally shifts into her rat form and scurries inside, while Tian stands at the door, keeping watch. Ziva and Milos enter the room, where Victor, visibly shaken and scarred by earlier events, awaits.

During the exchange, Victor divulges key information:

* He gained his knowledge of magic by observing elves in a reformation center.  
* He claims ignorance about the **Bloodstone’s** exact nature but shares that the elf described it as the key to escaping Barovia. Victor believes his teleportation circle, though incomplete, might work with the **Bloodstone's** power.  
* It was the elf’s idea to come to the village  
* The **Bloodstone** is tied to ancient energies within the land.  
* His sole desire is to leave Barovia and continue his studies. He promises further cooperation in exchange for his freedom.  
* Victor admits frustration over the party’s invasion of his home and the theft of his belongings, though he insists he bears no enmity toward them.

As Ziva presses further on the **Bloodstone**, Victor is suddenly overcome, choking as if an unseen force grips him. Whatever has taken hold mocks Ziva, warning that persistent questioning will lead to Victor’s death. Recognizing the danger, Ziva changes tactics, asking about Stella and her madness. With some deception from Milos, Victor describes three potential cures:

1. Magical reversal of the damage by a skilled arcanist like himself.  
2. Healing through a powerful priest.  
3.  A potion requiring a rare ingredient—the blood of an angel.

The mention of angelic blood brings to mind the blood taken from Sally by Wachter, raising questions about its potential properties.

Back at the house, Victor is left in the basement as the party decides to deliver him as a "gift" to Wachter, while presenting the zombified elf to the villagers for their judgment. Izek returns Milos’s ring and expresses a desire to find purpose. He reveals his longing for stability and applies for the post of guard captain in the village, a role Tian encourages him to pursue.

Later, Milos discusses with Sally his plans to retrieve his mother. Inadvertently, he reveals doubts about her survival, prompting Ziva to question Lathander’s promise to keep her alive. Milos lies, concealing the truth of the bargain he struck. Though Ziva senses his dishonesty, she refrains from pressing further.

While Sally changes into Ireena’s old clothes, Tian approaches her, admitting he overheard her conversation with Shar. He shares his own haunting experience of meeting Shar in death, a memory that clearly weighs on him, though he strives to maintain his composure.

The party proceeds to the village square for the meeting. The villagers gather, somber yet curious. Izmark struggles to begin his speech but regains his composure with encouragement from Milos. He speaks passionately, vowing to restore Barovia and unite its people. He presents the elf, recounting his crimes, and though the villagers are unsettled by the elf’s undead appearance, they demand execution. Izmark solemnly carries out the sentence, decapitating the elf.

Milos asks Ziva to contact Arabelle, requesting the use of Moonshade. Arabelle responds with a tirade of colorful language, expressing her displeasure. Meanwhile, Laszlo is informed of the plan to leave. After heartfelt goodbyes, Milos, Sally, and Laszlo set out on their journey, while Tian, Ziva, and Ireena remain to help rebuild the village.

In the forest, Tian and Ireena gather medicinal herbs, successfully collecting the necessary supplies within hours. 

Meanwhile, Ziva makes her way to the church, determined to heal the sick and bring relief to the elderly. The dim light filtering through the stained glass windows casts a solemn glow over the room, where patients lie in various states of suffering. She finds Melina, the head nurse, efficiently coordinating care despite the overwhelming burden. After a brief discussion, they prioritize the most critical cases.

Ziva begins her work, invoking every healing spell at her disposal. Her magic flows steadily, mending wounds, soothing pain, and restoring vitality. Hours pass as she hobbles on her crutch from one patient to the next, her resolve unwavering. Seven grueling hours later, the once-dismal atmosphere in the church transforms. Patients who had groaned in agony now smile with relief. The weight of despair lifts, replaced by laughter and gratitude. Joy and lightheartedness fill the sacred space.

Melina approaches Ziva, her voice trembling with emotion as she thanks her for the miraculous aid. In a gesture of deep respect, Melina bows before her, tears of gratitude glistening in her eyes. As Ziva takes a moment to catch her breath, a familiar warmth envelops her—a presence she recognizes as Lathander.

His voice resonates gently in her mind, filled with a divine grace. He remarks that she rarely asks anything of Him. Ziva, with quiet sincerity, replies that He has already given her what she most desired on that fateful morning. All she wishes now is to not feel alone in the world.

Lathander's reply carries both wisdom and reassurance. She does not need the favor of gods to find belonging, He tells her. All she needs is to look around—to see the people who stand beside her and the lives she has touched. With that, the divine presence fades, leaving Ziva surrounded by the warmth and gratitude of those she has healed, a reminder of the bonds she has forged through her compassion and strength.

Afterwards, Ziva approaches Burg and Clit, two villagers, with a sense of urgency, laying out their task with precision. She instructs them to speak with the townsfolk, seeking candidates for the vacant position of priest at the church. The role, she explains, must be filled by someone both compassionate and steadfast, capable of restoring hope to the villagers.

After setting them to their task, Ziva finds Ireena, and the two begin discussing potential improvements to the church. Their conversation turns to the church's basement, a space currently unused and filled with potential. Together, they envision transforming it into a clinic—a dedicated healing area that could serve the village more effectively. Ziva suggests Sally as the natural choice to lead this effort, given her medical expertise and resourcefulness.

The conversation shifts, and Ziva cautiously broaches the topic of Milos. She recounts the revelation of his vampiric nature, voicing her own concerns and uncertainties. Ireena listens intently, her expression conflicted as she grapples with the disparity between the boy she once knew and the creature Milos claims to be.

Curiosity getting the better of her, Ziva asks if there was ever anything more than friendship between Ireena and Milos. Ireena hesitates before admitting that she might have harbored a childhood crush on him but never revealed her feelings. Her admission is tinged with a mixture of nostalgia and regret, a reminder of simpler times overshadowed by their grim reality.

Meanwhile, Tian takes an active role in assisting Izmark with the delicate task of organizing the town's political structure. He lends his strategic mind to the endeavor, helping to shape a system that will ensure stability and fairness. Together, they work to strengthen the foundation of the village, paving the way for a brighter future amid the shadows of Barovia.

Elsewhere, on the road to Lake Zarovich, Sally and Milos discuss his past decision to join the rebellion. Though his memory is hazy, he recalls being driven by a powerful resolve, possibly connected to Ireena. Their conversation is interrupted when Laszlo suddenly dismounts and runs into the forest, leading Milos to a pond. There, Laszlo reflects on his past, revealing the spot where he first met Marika during a moment of despair. He pulls out her handkerchief, confessing the pain he caused her despite their shared love. With sorrow in his voice, he acknowledges her absence and releases the handkerchief into the water, watching it drift away.

They start moving again, in the direction of Lake Zarovich. Sally and Milos spot figures in the distance, their forms indistinct against the horizon. Sally moves ahead to investigate, her movements silent and deliberate. She discovers a group of guards deep in argument. Their weathered gear and tense demeanor mark them as former Vallaki guards, now seeking shelter in the Village of Barovia and searching for Captain Strazni.

Returning to Milos, Sally reports her findings, and they decide to approach the group. To announce their presence, Sally casts **Light**, illuminating the path ahead. The guards immediately tense, weapons raised in suspicion. After a cautious exchange, recognition dawns, and the guards lower their defenses, questioning Sally about Izek's whereabouts.

The guards explain that Vallaki has fallen into turmoil under its new regime. Daniel Moroz, Izek's right-hand man, steps forward, imploring Milos and Sally to send any loyal defectors his way. He warns them of patrols by new guards dressed in black, loyal to the new leadership. Sally and Milos advise the group to continue to the Village, stating they have matters to resolve first.

Upon reaching the lake, Sally casts **Water Walk**, and the group begins galloping across the water's surface, their reflections rippling beneath them. The distant lights of Vallaki flicker faintly, hinting at activity within the beleaguered town. As they cross, lightning bolts arc through the sky, jagged streaks of light traveling upward from the ground—a display that feels unnatural, perhaps the work of the Mad Mage.

On the far side of the lake, Sally casts **Locate Creature** after Milos describes his mother. A faint, guiding pulse leads them forward, deeper into the wilderness.

The pulse brings them to a small cave. Its interior tells a story of desperation—failed attempts to light fires scatter the ground. In the dim light, they find Marika's lifeless body, her hands cradling a wooden carving resembling Milos’ holy symbol. Milos rushes to her side, trying **Lay on Hands** in vain. She is gone. Overcome, he pounds the cave walls, his anguish filling the air.

As Laszlo steps closer, something unusual happens. Ziva, still in the Village, awakens with a start. Though lying in her bed, she sees through Laszlo's eyes, feels his emotions, and hears his thoughts. His grief and self-loathing overwhelm her, his longing to undo the pain he caused Marika cutting deep. He looks at the woman he caused so much pain to and he wishes he could rewind time to make amends for his sins. Just one last chance. One last chance to make amends, but he knows he can't. There are no more chances. Ziva experiences his sorrow as her own before slipping free from his consciousness, left weeping and praying to Lathander.

Milos, consumed by his own despair, suddenly senses a presence. Turning, he sees an ancient figure radiating a light so brilliant it seems to pierce the darkness itself. Lathander, clad in golden armor and a crown of sunlight, steps forward, droplets of radiance falling from him.

The deity addresses Milos with a voice like dawn breaking over the mountains. He speaks of redemption as a journey fraught with trials and reveals the cruel truth: Marika’s death was never preventable. Her passing was part of a test, one meant to shape Milos’ path toward the light.

His words boom, driving away the darkness around them:

* *"Child of darkness, you have embarked on a path of redemption, seeking to cast off the shadows. You wish to embrace the light I represent, but such a transformation is not easily earned, not by someone like you”*  
* *“Redemption is a journey of trials and tests, where one’s true nature is revealed.”*  
* *“Your mother's passing was indeed a trial, though it may not seem just from mortal eyes.”*  
* *“I understand your pain and I want you to know the truth of what transpired: when you faced that crucial decision, I never intended to keep your mother alive. The choice you made was always meant to be a test of your devotion. Your love for her was undeniable, but your capacity to choose the path of light over darkness was what I needed to witness.”*  
* *“Yes, my child, I let her die. The pain of that choice, the agony of losing someone you held dear, it is part of a crucible through which I sought to forge your commitment to the light. Your transformation is not about erasing your past, but embracing the trials that define your journey.”*

Milos' anger erupts. Shadows spill from him as he demands to know what is required of him now. Lathander responds that he seeks nothing but will set trials before Milos to test his worthiness for redemption. When asked if he resents Lathander for the truth, Milos’ rage flares. He raises his scythe to strike but stops, trembling, inches from the deity's throat. Dropping his weapon, he swears through gritted teeth: as long as he can pursue vengeance, he will follow.

Lathander, unmoved, acknowledges that vengeance can be righteous. With those words, he vanishes.

Sally and Laszlo, bewildered, stare at Milos. They saw nothing, heard nothing, only the shadowy remnants of Milos’ fury. Sally questions him, but Milos storms out, venting his rage on the forest, felling trees with unrelenting strikes of divine wrath.

After a while, he comes back and they wrap Marika's body for transportation back to the Village. Along the way, they encounter the guards from earlier. Sally strikes up conversation, learning more about Vallaki under its new regime. Wachter has taken control as Burgomaster, abolishing Vargas’ oppressive laws and opening trade, even with the Vistani. Streets are cleaner, and a statue rises in the town square, but whispers of disappearances in the night persist. Wachter has decreed that Strahd’s name may be spoken, though worship is not required—only acknowledgment of his dominion.

Milos intervenes, his voice cold and commanding. He warns the guards that betrayal of Izek or the Village will result in dire consequences. His tone leaves no room for doubt.

They arrive back in the Village the next morning. Milos and Laszlo take Marika’s body to the cemetery while Sally goes to the burgomaster’s house to fetch the others. At the house, Ziva, still shaken from her connection to Laszlo, joins the group for breakfast. Sally arrives at the house and takes note of the group, then asks them to join at the cemetery. The group heads over, with Ziva and Milos performing the funeral rites, the ceremony somber and heavy with unspoken grief.

In the following days, the party focuses on rebuilding the Village.

* **Izek** prepares to reunite with his men, but Sally advises patience, assuring him they are on their way.  
* **Milos** recruits and trains new guards and hunters, ensuring the Village’s defenses.  
* **Tian** continues organizing the town’s political structure, laying the groundwork for stability.  
* **Ziva** rehabilitates the church, cleaning the graveyard and selecting two individuals to succeed Father Donavich. She enchants an eternal flame upon the altar, a symbol of the Morninglord’s presence, its flickering light reciting his tenets.  
* **Sally** establishes the basement clinic, repurposing the space for healing and care.

Milos leads his new apprentice to the square, where he orders the gathering of restless spirits for banishment. Meanwhile, Ziva and Sally team up to clear the river, constructing a new stone bridge to replace the old one.

The next day, Ziva wakes to find her leg fully healed, her crutches no longer needed. The party gathers to prepare for their next journey. As they assemble, Milos enters the room, Victor following behind in peasant clothing, his expression timid.

To the party’s shock and horror, Milos reveals that Victor is no longer fully human—he has been transformed into a vampire spawn, bound to Milos’ will.

Milos calmly explains that Victor is now his spawn, fully under his control. His plan is to send Victor to Wachter, hoping the young vampire can begin the process of curing Stella. The revelation stuns Ziva and Ireena, who recoil at the implications of Victor’s transformation. In stark contrast, Sally and Tian appear unbothered, their expressions neutral.

Ziva accuses Milos of robbing Victor of his choice, binding him in eternal servitude—an act not unlike what Strahd inflicted upon Milos himself. The words cut deeply. Without hesitation, Milos recalls Victor, then ends the boy's existence with brutal efficiency. A stake to the heart, a swift decapitation, and a blaze of cleansing fire leave no trace of Victor but ash. The party watches, frozen in shock, as Milos stalks back inside. Ireena follows, her expression unreadable. Ziva, silent and grim, salvages Victor’s head from the ashes.

After Milos and Ireena leave, Tian gathers Sally and Ziva to confess his absence the previous night. He reveals that he dined with Strahd, having honored an invitation extended some time ago. This admission is met with disbelief, and the two women waste no time chastising him.

Tian recounts his time at Castle Ravenloft. He describes Strahd’s amusement over Victor’s futile attempts to escape Barovia using the **Bloodstone**, an artifact even Strahd admits he cannot fully understand. Strahd spoke of a game he and Madame Eva are playing, a contest seemingly entwined with Barovia’s fate. Strahd concluded their meeting by extending an invitation for the entire party to dine with him.

The atmosphere remains tense. Sally, still unsettled, asks Ziva about her connection to Shar. Suspicious of Sally's intentions, Ziva refuses to answer, fearing her words will only fuel Sally’s impulsive anger. Before the tension can escalate further, Sally notices the Vallaki guards arriving and heads off to speak with them, leaving Tian and Ziva alone.

Tian seizes the moment to plant a seed of doubt, suggesting that Strahd might offer Ziva what she seeks. His words unnerve her, and she falls into a catatonic state before heading silently to the church.

Back at the Burgomaster’s house, Ireena confronts Milos over his actions. Milos defends his choices, insisting that everything he does is to increase their chances of defeating Strahd. Ireena, however, challenges him, pointing out his chilling echo of past words: *“At any cost”*—words he once used to justify recruiting villagers for the rebellion. Her accusation strikes a nerve as she reveals that Milos, not the Mad Mage, rallied those people to their deaths.

Haunted by her words, Milos descends into the basement, his thoughts spiraling. Overwhelmed, he unleashes his frustration, destroying parts of Ireena’s home in a fit of anger.

Meanwhile, Sally speaks with the newly arrived Vallaki guards, who reveal that Anca was lost during an ambush by the new regime’s forces. The news unsettles her. Izek expresses his desire to help his men but decides to stay, believing his presence is vital to the Village. However, his conversation with Tian is fraught with tension. Feeling undervalued, Izek accuses Tian of indifference before the brothers part on strained terms.

Milos, having emerged from the house, joins Sally and Tian. Noticing Ziva’s absence, the group sets out to find her.

Ziva, drawn to the church, hears Shar’s voice urging her to embrace the darkness and understand her connection to the goddess. Entering, she acknowledges the workers with a distracted wave before sitting in a pew to contemplate her next steps. The rest of the party finds her there, still lost in thought.

Ireena, exasperated, declares that the group’s divisions are hindering their progress. She insists they need to work together and start by understanding each other. After a heavy silence, the party begins to open up.

Ziva reveals she is searching for a man named Villeneuve, connected to the murder of her friend in Waterdeep, her only remaining lead. Tian admits his goal is to uncover the truth about himself and his connection to Barovia. Sally shares her quest for vengeance for the destruction of her clan, dismissing Ziva’s warnings about the futility of confronting Shar. Milos speaks of his longing to banish Strahd and feel the sun on his face again.

As tensions resurface, Tian confesses about his meeting with Strahd the previous night. Milos responds with a punch, a blunt punctuation to Tian’s revelations. The group, now somewhat united, prepares to leave the Village. Before departing, Milos has a final, somber conversation with his father.

On the road to Tser’s Pool, the group encounters a massive black carriage. Strahd himself steps out, greeting Ireena as Tatyana and offering the party a ride. After some hesitation, the group accepts, boarding the carriage.

During the journey, Strahd extends a formal invitation to dine with him, engaging each party member in pointed conversation. They discuss the nature of power, both magical and divine. Milos prods Strahd about his amnesia, only to learn that it is part of a deliberate plan. Strahd briefly examines Milos’ overlapping holy symbols, smiling enigmatically as he remarks on Milos’ uniqueness. Strahd confirms that Milos’ shadowy powers do not originate from him, marking Milos as a curiosity.

Milos, in turn, exposes Escher’s attempts to contact the party behind Strahd’s back. Strahd acknowledges the information, but his reaction remains inscrutable. The carriage arrives at Tser’s Pool, and Strahd reiterates his invitation as the party disembarks.

The group is greeted by Arabelle, who immediately unleashes a tirade of colorful insults at Milos. She halts abruptly upon noticing Strahd’s presence. Strahd enters Madame Eva’s tent, leaving the party to their own devices.

Sally approaches Rahadin, attempting to glean information while concealing her knowledge of his history from the Tome. Rahadin remains cold and distant, his demeanor frosty.

After his meeting with Eva, Strahd is approached by Arabelle, who questions him with an audacious curiosity. Strahd answers each of her inquiries with dignity and patience before heading back toward his carriage. At the edge of the camp, he casually disables its magical protections before departing, leaving an unsettling stillness in his wake.

Ireena stands pale, her resolve unwavering. She contemplates the mysterious dinner invitation and suggests the party should attend. Her gaze drifts into the distance as she mutters softly, the word *“constant”* just audible to Ziva. Turning back, Ireena questions Ziva about her change of heart regarding the dinner, noting Ziva's earlier opposition to Tian going alone. Ziva explains that her concern was Tian’s secrecy, not the idea of attending. Now, curiosity drives her; this meeting could reveal crucial truths.

When Ireena presses Ziva about Strahd’s remarks, Ziva shares the story of her friend's murder in Waterdeep. The man Strahd mentioned is central to her investigation—a vital lead she cannot afford to lose. Before the weight of this conversation settles, Arabelle reappears, brimming with excitement over her exchange with Strahd. She dreams of leaving the camp for adventure. Meanwhile, Araja and Rina approach, explaining that Strahd’s visit was unexpected; he hasn’t shown himself here in a century, having been in a deep slumber.

As Tian inspects the camp’s food preparations, Arabelle corners him, probing him about his dinner with Strahd. Though she glimpsed fragments of his experience, she demands assurance that he won’t betray the group. Tian dismisses her worries and offers a distraction: an exhilarating flight above the camp. Arabelle, thrilled, declares it far superior to Moonshade’s efforts. This prompts Milos to dismiss Moonshade entirely, further souring Arabelle’s mood.

The party enters Madame Eva’s tent, leaving a pouting Arabelle outside. Before stepping in, Ziva whispers to Arabelle about Milos’s mother, softening the young Vistana’s demeanor. Inside, the enigmatic seer greets the group, and the conversation turns to questions of fate, free will, and the tangled web of Barovia. Eva speaks cryptically of her bond with Strahd and her role as a weaver of fates, compelled by the magics of the land to guide each soul along its destined path. Yet she reveals Strahd himself has endlessly tried to reshape the tapestry of Barovia, his will clashing with fate itself.

Eva challenges the group, asking whose will brought them to Barovia. Tian and Ziva suspect it was Eva’s, and the seer confirms it. She chose them, wild cards with untapped potential, to stir the stagnant threads of fate. Her gaze falls on Ziva, foretelling choices and crossroads ahead. Eva hints that Ziva and Arabelle share a deeper connection, two frayed threads bound to weave a stronger pattern. 

Arabelle wants to travel with the party, but if they won’t take her with them, she’ll set off on her own.

When Milos rebuffs the idea of predestination, Eva counters, explaining that fate and free will intertwine. Every action creates ripples, and the weave of possibility is vast. Turning to Sally, Eva speaks of vengeance, posing a question: what price is she willing to pay for it?

Ziva ventures a bold question, recounting the vision she shared with Arabelle and wondering if touching Eva might unveil similar insights. When their hands meet, Ziva is overwhelmed by a storm of memories—hers, strangers’, and others unplaceable. Forced to break the connection, she is left shaken. Eva reassures her, cryptically suggesting the old woman in Ziva’s vision is closer than expected and will soon cross their path.

Emerging from Eva’s tent, the party finds Arabelle waiting impatiently. When asked to delay their departure, her frustration boils over. In a flash, she vanishes. Alarmed, Ziva calls for her, and Milos rushes back inside the tent to consult Eva. Lighting a cigarette, the seer explains that Arabelle has accidentally phased into the Astral Plane. Moments later, Arabelle reappears, visibly shaken and furious, refusing to speak to the group before storming off.

Ireena, still composed, shares what she has learned from Araja and Rina about Vallaki. The city has changed: festivals are banned, trade is flourishing, and people enjoy greater freedoms. Yet dissent is crushed with brutal efficiency, and critics vanish without a trace. Most disturbingly, two children who spoke out against Wachter’s rule have disappeared. The group debates whether Fiona Wachter is a tyrant, ultimately concluding that while she craves power, her leadership has brought stability to the city.

Back in the camp, Sally, Ireena, and Ziva attempt to decode another chapter of the *Tome of Strahd*. After hours of effort, Ireena and Ziva abandon the task, leaving Sally to persist alone. Meanwhile, Tian and Milos train together before finding other ways to pass the time. Ziva seeks out Milos privately, apologizing for her earlier outburst and asking how he is coping with his mother’s death. Milos answers tersely, steering the conversation toward his encounter with Lathander in the cave. Their discussion shifts to faith and religion until Shar’s voice intrudes in Ziva’s mind, taunting her.

Milos grows impatient and poses pointed questions about belief and independence. Ziva struggles for answers, distracted by Shar’s whispers. Seeking common ground, she confides in Milos about her visit to Doru and her decision to feed him. Milos’s anger flares as he chastises her for empowering Doru, potentially endangering others. When Ziva defends her actions as compassionate, Milos retorts that her mercy led to Doru’s death and storms off, his frustration palpable.

Sally eventually joins the group, announcing she has deciphered the tome’s passage. Together, the party returns to the tent to read.

Strahd stands before the party once again, a figure of commanding presence and regal pride. His voice resonates through the void, carrying a deep sense of conviction: *"I have built a castle to house the people I loved, after years of warring. This was supposed to be my legacy."* As his words fade, so does his form, dissolving into the ether.

The vision shifts abruptly. The group now finds themselves in an opulently furnished room, rich tapestries and gilded accents hinting at its grandeur. Here, they witness the partitioning of Barovia among the great vassal houses of the Von Zarovich family. Boris Vallakovich is granted the lands destined to become Vallaki. Vash Krezkova claims the territory that will one day form Krezk, along with oversight of the Wizards of the Wine, their former caretakers having vanished during the wars. The Wachter and Durst houses receive their shares of power, but the conspicuous absence of the DeLysnias from these proceedings speaks volumes.

Andral steps forward, addressing Strahd with deference yet candor. He informs the lord that Markovia seeks to depart the castle, intending to establish an abbey dedicated to spreading the teachings of the Morninglord. Strahd, his tone sharp with dismissal, remarks that her departure is for the best. She doesn’t know her place, and will certainly not be missed.

Milos seizes the moment, approaching Andral directly with a question about the Morninglord. He reveals his two symbols, tarnished and enigmatic. Andral examines them thoughtfully, speculating that they might represent the Morninglord’s symbol, though warped and corrupted.

Tian, meanwhile, turns to Alek with a pointed question about her brother, Godfrey. Her response carries a mix of bitterness and sorrow. She reveals that she tried desperately to save him, even as he committed what she describes as a grievous sin—falling in love with another man. Her words trail into a cautionary tale of unnatural creatures surrounding Argynvostholt and persistent attacks on supply chains.

Ziva approaches Andral again, weaving a tale of a haunting dream that serves as a veiled description of Barovia's current desolation. She asks how hope might be rekindled in such a bleak land. Andral’s response is simple yet profound: *“Hope is kindled by light. Spread enough light, and hope will ignite.”*

Sally confronts Strahd directly, her voice steady with curiosity. She asks what he envisions for the future now that the wars are over. How will his legacy endure? Strahd’s reply is measured, tinged with both satisfaction and ambition. He reflects on the sacrifices of his youth, offered willingly to secure a future for his people and family. But his thoughts shift to the land itself, acknowledging its latent power and myriad secrets—secrets he is determined to uncover.

The vision shifts again, coalescing into a grand meeting room. Strahd is seated at the head of a table, exuding authority. Andral and Sergei, dressed in the ceremonial garb of Morninglord priests, enter, their conversation animated and earnest.

Their discussion is interrupted by the arrival of an envoy—a priest of the Morninglord named Kiril Romulich. He carries a box with careful reverence, the air around him heavy with anticipation. Kiril announces that he bears news and a gift, a product of the priesthood’s tireless efforts. He opens the box, but what it contains remains elusive, its form obscured by some strange distortion that defies perception.

Kiril proclaims the object to be a symbol of Lathander’s power, designed to consecrate the land itself. Milos, drawn to the mysterious artifact, glimpses a faint glimmer of color, hinting at a reflective surface. As he focuses, a searing pain ignites in his chest, forcing him to recoil. Meanwhile, Ziva perceives the object’s magic—its essence radiates comfort, an unmistakable aura of hope and renewal.

The party observes Ziva kneel before the mysterious relic, drawn by its palpable magic. Sergei, Andral, and Kiril also feel its pull, each remarking on how it brings them closer to the Morninglord. Ziva experiences this connection as she approaches the object, but Milos feels only pain as he nears it.

Andral examines the relic, impressed by its immense power. He declares it a force capable of protecting the land and blessing the castle. Strahd, though clearly irritated by the display, maintains a diplomatic air. He entrusts Andral with the relic and the task of consecrating the castle. Sergei is in awe of the gift and expresses gratitude for Strahd's acceptance of it. Kiril remarks on Sergei's lack of formal decorum, noting it is a trait missed back home.

Strahd redirects the conversation to the broader vision of Barovia, emphasizing his intent to unify the land further. Despite inheriting his father's title as king after his death, Strahd has declined the crown until Barovia reaches its full greatness. Sergei, astonished, questions this choice, but Strahd explains that he will only accept the crown once he fulfills his father's ambitions.

A knock interrupts the gathering. Milos opens the door to reveal an imposing woman clad in the armor of the Morninglord. Her piercing blue eyes and black hair mark her as Aurica Markovia. As her gaze sweeps the room, she bows respectfully to the conclave of priests, but her expression hardens when her eyes meet Strahd’s. He mirrors her steely demeanor, their mutual disdain evident.

Markovia inquires about the relic, expressing a desire to see it. Approaching the object, she is astounded by the connection she feels to the Morninglord.

Kiril produces a sealed parchment, handed to him by Andral, as they discuss an issue previously communicated. Andral confirms the paperwork is in order. Sergei, confused, receives the scroll. Sally and Milos examine it, discovering it is a list of priests of the Morninglord. Milos also inspects Sergei's sword, noting its unusual sheath, which appears magically small. The blade itself is absent, likely summoned and dismissed through magic.

Andral reveals that the scroll pertains to his succession. At nearly eighty years old, he is preparing to step down as Dawnmaster but will remain at the castle to guide his successor. Sergei, shocked, protests, insisting he needs Andral's counsel. Andral reassures him, but Sergei's dismay grows as Markovia declines the position, stating her intention to build an abbey to serve the people directly. The successor, it is revealed, will be Sergei.

Strahd watches the proceedings silently, narrowing his eyes as his gaze lingers on Sergei’s sword. Sergei, overwhelmed, initially refuses to believe he is fit for the role, but Andral encourages him. After a subtle nod of approval from Strahd, Sergei kneels and accepts the position, vowing to do his best as Dawnmaster.

The vision glitches, skipping frames like a damaged memory. It resumes with Andral placing a glitched object—perhaps the Symbol of Ravenkind—in Sergei's hands, alongside the **Brightblade** of King Barov. Worry creases Sergei's features, and Markovia watches with visible discontent.

As the vision fades, Ireena questions the party. She notes the strangeness of the visions, particularly Strahd's animosity toward Lathander. The discussion turns to Strahd's history with faith. Once indifferent, he grew embittered after the clerics of Lathander failed to save his mother. While he tolerates the religion, he holds it in contempt, refusing to submit to it.

The mists reform into Strahd’s office, where he sits deep in thought before an open book. The title, *The Von Zarovich Bloodline,* catches the party's eye. Milos, sensing turbulence in Strahd’s mind, peers closer and glimpses flashes of vivid imagery: a bearded king yelling at a boy, battles, Rahadin, moments in the castle, and a regal woman with sharp features. Other scenes follow—a woman with black hair gazing kindly at him, another with braided white hair telling stories, a deathly skeletal figure in royal robes, and the crushing weight of mortality.

Ireena approaches Strahd, her curiosity evident as she moves closer to observe what has captured his attention. Her question hangs in the air: *"What are you thinking about?"*

The party is drawn into Strahd’s mind, where images swirl and coalesce as his voice resonates: *"What does my legacy mean? What am I left to achieve? How much time do I have to accomplish it? With death looming ever closer, I am consumed by thoughts of my youth—or the lack of it."*

When Ireena asks if he considers himself a good man, the imagery shifts violently. Visions of bloodshed and war unfold—the lives lost by his hand, the unforgiving brutality of leadership. Finally, his answer comes, heavy with conviction: *"No, I am not a good man, not by definition. But I bear the responsibility and make the hard decisions so that others will not have to."*

The images soften, though the sadness and longing linger beneath them. Strahd's pride in the weight he carries is clear—his unyielding determination to fulfill his father’s dream of building an empire, even at great personal cost.

When Ireena presses further, asking if he has ever loved or is capable of love, the imagery explodes in a chaotic search for answers. His eyes glisten with an unguarded humanity. *"I don't know,"* he finally admits. *"I was never allowed to. I was never given the time. I’m not even sure if I loved my father or mother."*

As he speaks, an image surfaces—a woman with long white hair, her presence commanding yet enigmatic. Ziva focuses on her, feeling an inexplicable pull, but the figure remains shrouded in mystery.

Ziva then shifts the conversation, asking about the skeletal figure seen earlier in the vision. Strahd’s reply is curt, almost dismissive: *"An option."*

When asked why he harbors such hatred for his brother, his answer is laden with bitterness. *"He is everything I was denied. He grew up in my chambers, surrounded by the same people, yet he was granted a childhood. He had the luxury of time and mistakes, while I had none. But I am more than he could ever be."*

The topic turns to Sergei’s inheritance of the sword. A vision materializes of the blade—at first, only its pommel and a faint shaft of light. Gradually, radiant sunlight pours forth, forming a weapon of divine brilliance. A regal, dark-haired man with streaks of white points the sword at Strahd. His voice echoes: *"My son, one day you will take this, but only if you heed my words. Only if you do what must be done."*

Strahd’s response to this memory carries quiet defiance: *"I refused it, as I refused the crown. I will build this kingdom myself, without his crown, without his blade, and without his influence."*

When asked what would bring him happiness, a flash of anger erupts, followed by confusion. *"I don’t know,"* he admits, his voice softer now. *"I wish for one life. One life where I can choose, where I can make my own mistakes. But time has run out. Responsibility has consumed me."*

Questions about the holy relic presented earlier by Kiril elicit disdain. *"I care nothing for their god, their relics, or their consecrations. This place was built to honor my father’s legacy and make my mother proud, not to serve their faith."*

Finally, the party probes Strahd’s conquest of Barovia, asking if it was motivated by hidden powers. He dismisses the notion: *"No. I conquered this land to fulfill my father’s dream. But the land is... unique. Its mysteries intrigued me once I learned of them."*

As the mental landscape fades, the weight of Strahd’s reflections lingers—an intricate mix of ambition, bitterness, and longing for a life that was never his to live.

The party is pushed out from his thoughts for having asked too many invasive questions. Strahd brings out the **Tome of Strahd** and he starts to write in it: 

***“More than 4 centuries before, after Droston's death, king Barov I, my great great great grandfather, became head of our house.***

***The kingdom thrived for 200 years until barbarians and rebellions drove our family to exile.***  
***The dream of Zarovia was passed to my father, king Barov.***

***100 years after their exile, my father took up arms to reclaim his legacy. Through cunning and wealth he built an army and began to carve out his territory. Barov's crusade was made holy when Andral anointed him as king, and so, the war of reclaiming our lost homeland became a holy war.***

***With Andral’s help, our war turned into a crusade, and with my father’s help, Andral became the new Dawnmaster.***

***The dusk elves that lived in that region refused to pay tribute to Barov, so he swiftly declared war on them.”***

As the passage is read, the vision shifts and solidifies. The party stands in the midst of a battlefield, the chaos of war erupting around them. It is the conflict between King Barov's forces and the dusk elves. Barov’s army holds the advantage of sheer numbers, but the dusk elves know the terrain well and have entrenched themselves in superior positions.

The party finds themselves among Barov’s soldiers, immersed in the swirling tide of battle. Rahadin, standing at King Barov's side, provides detailed intelligence about the dusk elves' tactics and defenses. Despite his assistance, Barov's words are measured, his tone skeptical. He reminds Rahadin that trust is not yet earned, though the value of his knowledge is undeniable.

Rahadin's backstory becomes evident in his next declaration: he is the banished son of the dusk elf king, severing all ties with his kin. With cold conviction, he pledges his loyalty to King Barov, vowing to see the dusk elves eradicated. Barov accepts this vow but issues a warning. Erevan Lowenheart, the dusk elf king, is no fool, and their steps must be taken with caution. Rahadin’s face remains impassive as Barov speaks another chilling directive: Prince Erevan, the king of the dusk elves, must die.

Barov’s command signals the start of the war. The dusk elf army surges forward, charging with precision and purpose. Arrows rain from their archers, forcing the party to react quickly. With skill and agility, they evade or deflect the incoming barrage.

The counterattack begins. The party plunges into the fray, cutting through the ranks of dusk elf warriors with lethal efficiency. Sally transforms into her beast form, a blur of claws and fury. Tian takes to the skies, raining devastating blows from above. Milos weaves through the chaos, his blade cutting down enemies in swift arcs. Ziva conjures a towering wall of fire, forcing the elves into a bottleneck. Funneled and exposed, they are easy prey for Milos and Tian, whose combined assault decimates their ranks.

Their exceptional combat prowess does not go unnoticed. Amid the clamor of the battlefield, four dusk elves astride wyverns descend from the skies, their gaze locked on the party. The wyverns' wings beat against the air, stirring dust and ash as the riders circle with predatory precision. The battlefield seems to momentarily narrow as the four powerful foes prepare to engage, their presence a stark reminder that the dusk elves are far from defeated.

The battlefield erupts with chaos as four wyvern riders, all female, descend from the sky. Their mounts crash to the ground with thunderous impact, and their riders point gleaming lances at the party, marking them as quarry in the guttural tones of the Draconic language. The party splits up to face their foes. Ireena, Ziva, and Tian each engage a rider, while Sally and Milos team up to bring down the fourth.

Sally and Milos dispatch their adversary quickly, their coordination deadly and precise. They turn their attention to Ireena, who struggles against the ferocity of her wyvern and its rider. Meanwhile, Tian is struck down in his battle, falling unconscious for a moment, while Ziva is snatched up by her adversary and hurled into the sky.

Adrenaline surges through Tian, pulling him back to consciousness. With a roar, he re-enters the fray, joining the fight against the remaining grounded wyverns. Milos, ever watchful, notices Ziva plummeting from the heavens with her wyvern in hot pursuit. He positions himself beneath her, ready to catch her if needed.

At the last moment, Ziva’s quick thinking saves her. She casts **Misty Step**, reappearing atop the wyvern’s back. Yet, seeing Milos below and unwilling to endure another near-fatal fall, she leaps deliberately from the wyvern. She lands heavily on Milos, cushioning her descent, but the maneuver leaves her vulnerable. The wyvern lands directly on her moments later, its weight crushing her ribs.

The rest of the party converges on the remaining wyvern. With swift teamwork and unrelenting force, they bring it down. The battle subsides for a moment, the wyvern riders defeated, but the distant clash of steel reminds the party that the war is far from over.

In the distance, King Barov and his personal guard are locked in combat with an elite group of dusk elves. Among them stands their champion, a striking figure wielding a sword that glimmers like moonlight. The elves are losing ground, but their champion—a figure revealed as Erevan Lowenheart, king of the dusk elves—manages to knock Barov down in close quarters.

The party rushes toward the skirmish, but the distance is too great. As Erevan raises the **Moonsword** to deliver the killing blow, a shadow moves behind Barov. Rahadin, Erevan’s exiled son, emerges, his blade intercepting the **Moonsword** in a deafening clash that shatters the weapon into fragments.

Rahadin’s voice cuts through the chaos. His rage and betrayal are palpable as he denounces Erevan and the dusk elves who turned their backs on him. Without hesitation, Rahadin plunges his sword into his father’s chest, ending the champion’s life.

King Barov rises and clasps Rahadin’s shoulder, thanking him for saving his life. He declares Rahadin a member of his family and a trusted companion. Barov picks up the hilt of the shattered **Moonsword**, inspecting it closely. He announces that it will be reforged to serve the house von Zarovich.

As the party approaches, they recognize the hilt. It is the same as the **Brightblade**, the legendary weapon passed to Sergei, heir of the von Zarovich lineage, but spurned by Strahd. The mists swirl, engulfing the battlefield, and the scene shifts.

In Strahd’s office, he stands deep in thought, the weight of the **Brightblade** heavy in his memories. High priests had aided in forging the weapon from the shards of the **Moonsword**, and Strahd wonders if the blade holds secrets yet to be uncovered.

As his thoughts wander, an image of a woman materializes in his mind. She is older, with white braided hair—Lysaga. Memories of her flood back, spanning his childhood and adolescence.

He recalls her presence as he practiced sword forms, her hands weaving subtle arcane patterns to create dancing lights for him to strike. He remembers her finding him in the library as a young man, selecting books to nurture his curiosity about the arcane. One book, *The Unfathomable Power of the Arcane*, bore handwritten notes from her, detailing rituals to enhance weapons, including methods she claimed to have used on the **Brightblade** itself.

Another memory unfolds: Strahd as a restless child, tossing in the grip of nightmares. Lysaga sits by his bedside, her hands weaving silvery threads of magic to soothe him. Her voice is soft as she promises to always stay by his side, professing a love she claims surpasses even that of his mother, Queen Revanovia.

Then, a darker memory emerges. A young Strahd sleeps in his room as the door creaks open. Lysaga enters, her presence shadowy and unsettling. Locking the door with a whisper of arcane power, she approaches the bed. Her voice is a lullaby, sweet yet tinged with something unnatural. She strokes his hair as she sings:

*Hush now, my sweet, don't you cry,*  
*In the dark, under moonlit sky.*  
*Stars above, and shadows near,*  
*I'll keep you safe, have no fear.*

*In this land's night, where dreams take flight,*  
*Winds of magic, through endless night.*  
*Secrets concealed, in the dark's embrace,*  
*In my arms, you'll find your place.*

*Whispers of power, in the night's cool air,*  
*Secrets of magic, beyond compare.*  
*I'll cradle your soul, with a tender hand,*  
*In my world, you'll forever stand.*

*So close your eyes, my dear little one,*  
*In my love, our destinies are spun.*  
*Under the moon's spell, you shall be,*  
*Bound to me, for eternity.*

As she gazes at him, her visage shifts, becoming sallow and elongated, her hair wild and frizzy. Ziva’s realization dawns—this is the same woman from her visions, the one in the hut.

The mists swirl again, and the vision fades.

Back in Strahd’s office, he reflects aloud. Lysaga, he says, was more of a mother to him than Revanovia ever could be. When Revanovia uncovered Lysaga’s obsession with her son, she banished the woman from the castle. But the bond Lysaga had forged with Strahd was unshakable.

With his father’s death, Strahd inherited both the lands and the enemies of Barovia. Yet he craves more than a kingdom—he dreams of an empire. He rejects the **Brightblade** as a mere relic. He seeks a weapon worthy of his own making, one he will claim by his own hand.

The party awakens from the vision in the dead of night. Milos, visibly shaken by what he has seen, stumbles outside and retches, grappling with emotions he can barely process. Ziva retrieves her notebook, combing through her written records of past visions. She recounts to the party the horrifying image of Lysaga in the hut, slicing open the throat of an elderly woman—a memory tied to her visions of Lysaga advising druids to honor the Rozanas through ritual sacrifice. She recalls Madame Eva’s warning of the *"Mother of the Ancient"* and cautions the group about the peril Lysaga represents. The conclusion is unanimous: Lysaga is incredibly dangerous, and confronting her should be avoided if possible.

The discussion shifts to the party's next steps. Allies are crucial in this unwinnable fight, but their options are fraught with complications. The Keepers of the Feather remain a possibility, though relations with the Martikov family have soured due to Bray’s death. Ireena suggests collaborating with Lady Wachter, acknowledging that while the woman’s methods and values may not align with their own, her resources could prove invaluable. However, this plan poses its own challenges, particularly with Sally’s presence in the group.

Milos grows increasingly pale, his gaze distant. When pressed, he confesses that he sees too much of himself in Strahd and fears becoming like him. Ziva attempts to reason with him, acknowledging Strahd's humanity before his fall. Yet this sparks a heated argument, with Ireena and Milos emphasizing that understanding Strahd does not absolve him of his atrocities. Ziva, chastened by their rebuke, apologizes and withdraws from the conversation.

One by one, Ireena, Milos, and Ziva excuse themselves, each seeking solace in solitude. Sally and Tian remain behind, retiring to rest for the night.

Milos roams the camp, attempting to steady his mind. His gaze fixes on the bonfire as he calls out to Shar. The shadows coalesce before him, forming a dark silhouette that answers his summons. He questions her intentions, asking if she has designs on him or his past lives. Shar dismisses his concerns, stating her lack of interest in him—he is already on the path to understanding the nature of shadow and darkness. He then asks her what her plans for Ziva are. To this, she answers that in Ziva, she saw potential, power, brashness, stupidity and a naive understanding of life, and those are things that interest her. She offers no guarantees for Ziva’s survival, stating that her fate rests entirely in her own hands. With that, the shadow vanishes, leaving Milos alone before the fire. He eventually returns to the tent and drifts into uneasy sleep.

By the edge of Tser’s Pool, Ziva sits alone, grappling with self-doubt. She feels inadequate—unable to offer guidance, struggling with questions of faith, and failing to match her companions in combat. The thought of retirement crosses her mind, though she dismisses it on account of being far too young for it. She begins casting **Light** on pebbles and tossing them into the water. Her focus on the glimmering stones brings her into a trance, where she finds herself suspended in a timeless moment.

Lathander’s voice fills her mind, and she pours out her insecurities, confessing her fears and failures. Lathander reassures her that dogma is unimportant; it is her efforts to spread light and hope, despite dire circumstances, that truly matter. He reminds her that not all divine plans can be revealed, as mortal minds are not equipped to comprehend them fully. When she questions his decision to let Milos’ mother die, Lathander admits he lied, explaining that Milos needed a catalyst strong enough to begin his redemption arc.

Ziva presses further, asking if Milos holds special importance to him. Lathander responds that all souls are important. With this, his presence dissipates into embers, leaving Ziva with more questions than answers.

As the pebble resumes its descent, the surrounding darkness envelops her, plunging her into an endless void. Shar appears, offering her perspective. She challenges Ziva to embrace her failures, emphasizing that growth comes from learning through mistakes. When Ziva questions Shar’s prohibition of hope, the goddess chuckles, prompting Ziva to realize that forbidding hope only strengthens its allure. With a sly smile, Shar departs, leaving Ziva back at the lake's shore, more conflicted about the gods than ever. Seeking clarity, Ziva takes a swim before returning to camp. On her way back, she notices Ireena standing at the camp’s edge, speaking into the night. When Ireena returns, her tear-streaked face is unmistakable, but she avoids Ziva and heads straight to bed. Ziva begins work on her project before eventually retiring.

The party wakes at noon, each member occupied with their own tasks. Tian prepares a lavish brunch under the watchful eye of an elderly Vistana woman and begins teaching the Vistani fine dining techniques. Milos engages the camp’s children in his calisthenics, using them as impromptu weights to their delight. Sally, in eagle form, surveys the land, noting a jagged scar across the terrain and identifying three distinct points from which it emanates. She also spots a Vistani carriage approaching the camp.

Ziva finds Arabelle teaching a young boy to pickpocket and joins the mischief. The two discuss Arabelle’s training with Madame Eva, and Arabelle assures Ziva that while Eva’s methods are unconventional, they are effective. Ziva invites Arabelle to join the party, and the girl eagerly accepts. Ziva gifts Arabelle her custom armor, a gesture that fills the girl with excitement. She also gives Arabelle her custom crossbow, made in Luskan by a dwarf pirate. This statement doesn’t have the intended “wow” effect, as Arabelle doesn’t know what a pirate is. Ziva wants Arabelle to have something to remember her by, in case anything should happen to her.

While Tian prepares his meal, he notices a raven perched nearby, watching him with unnerving intensity. As he approaches, the raven takes flight, settling on a distant branch as if beckoning him to follow. Tian obliges, with Milos—who observed the interaction—silently trailing behind.

The raven leads Tian into an exhilarating chase, testing his agility with sharp turns and daring maneuvers. Tian mimics its movements, his keen instincts allowing him to keep pace. Milos, relying on his vampiric abilities, scales trees with supernatural ease to stay close.

The chase ends in a secluded clearing, where the raven finally lands. Tian cautiously approaches, but the bird’s gaze shifts sharply over his shoulder, its eyes narrowing as it detects something behind him. Without warning, the raven takes flight again, this time hurtling toward Milos’ hidden position.

As it reaches him, the raven dissolves into a swirling mist, reforming into the shape of a woman. In an instant, she grapples Milos, slamming him to the ground with a dagger pressed to his throat.

The woman is fair-skinned, her black hair shaved at the sides and streaked with a vivid blue. Dressed in leather and rugged traveling clothes, she exudes a dangerous confidence. As her eyes meet Milos’ face, recognition flickers in her expression. Her grip softens, and she helps him to his feet.

“How is this possible?” she asks, her voice edged with disbelief. “You’re supposed to be dead.”

Milos reels from the raven-woman’s cryptic words, his confusion mounting. He has no memory of her, nor any idea why she recognizes him. She, however, brushes his bewilderment aside with cold dismissal, warning him to stay put if he values his life.

Turning her attention to Tian, she issues an unceremonious challenge, striking him with the pommel of her sword. Her fury erupts as she brands him a murderer and betrayer, railing against his actions during the siege on the inn. She falsely accuses him of betraying Urwin and Danika, who had offered him sanctuary, and of killing Bray in cold blood during the attack.

In an unexpected turn, Milos attempts to mediate, his voice uncharacteristically measured. The woman cuts him off sharply, reminding him to stay out of it—this is between her and Tian. For once, Milos obeys, stepping back into silence.

The duel begins, Tian landing a few precise blows. However, the woman counters with an impressive display of martial prowess, catching him off guard with her fluid, monk-like movements. Tian tries to explain the events of the inn’s fall, but she refuses to entertain excuses. To her, this fight is not about explanations; it’s a test of Tian’s character, and so far, he is failing.

Her disdain grows, and she mutters that Davian, Urwin’s father,  was right all along, calling Urwin a fool for believing the party could still prove useful. She reveals that her purpose was to evaluate their trustworthiness, but Tian’s performance has convinced her that her time has been wasted. With a sharp motion, she transforms back into raven form and vanishes into the sky, leaving Milos as baffled as when it all began.

In the camp, Ziva is stretching, multitasking with her Spellshard to record notes. Nearby, Arabelle approaches in a makeshift bathing suit, gesturing toward Ziva’s project: a magically formed covered pool at the camp’s edge. The children, having filled it with water, play exuberantly in its depths.

Noticing Arabelle’s shivering form and blue-tinged lips, Ziva walks over to the pool, using her magic to heat the water and add a sparkling effect with **Faerie Fire***.* The children erupt in cheers, their delight infectious.

As Ziva watches them, Madame Eva emerges, also dressed for a swim. Despite her blindness, Eva ascends the steps to the pool with confident precision, ignoring Ziva’s offer of assistance. Ziva briefly zones out, struck by a sudden vision:

*Two differently colored strands intertwined into a tightly knit rope before her. Slowly, they begin to unravel, the pace quickening until the strands part completely. At the point where they diverge, a singular feeling emerges—choice.*

The vision dissolves as a splash of water strikes her face. Eva smiles knowingly, gesturing toward Arabelle. Ziva retaliates by splashing Arabelle, triggering a chaotic water fight among the children.

Milos and Tian return, recounting their encounter in the woods. The conversation shifts to the party’s plans for alliances. Ziva proposes leveraging the knowledge gleaned from Strahd’s Tome—or even the Tome itself—as a bargaining chip with the Keepers of the Feather. The party objects, fearing this would draw Strahd’s attention to the order.

The focus shifts to Fiona Wachter and the tense dynamic with Sally. Ziva posits that Fiona’s obsession with Sally may stem from a misinterpreted prophecy. Wachter believes Sally’s blood will restore the sun, but what if the “sun” is actually her daughter Stella? Victor had shared that Stella’s madness could be cured with a potion made from angelic blood—specifically, Sally’s blood. By curing Stella, the prophecy might still be fulfilled.

Ireena supports this idea, and the party debates its feasibility. The primary obstacle is their lack of knowledge about brewing the potion. Milos volunteers that he knows someone who might: Morgantha, the hag infamous for baking children into pies.

The party is horrified as Milos admits he once supplied Morgantha with children in exchange for magical items, justifying his actions as survival during his early days as a vampire. Ziva, enraged, lashes out with **Sacred Flame***,* but Milos dodges and storms out, visibly shaken. He retreats to the water’s edge, attempting in vain to reach out to Lathander.

With Milos gone, the party focuses on deciphering the next chapter of Strahd’s Tome, discovering its title: *Tatyana.* Tian concentrates on reconnecting with his human self, his features growing increasingly distinct.

When Sally goes to fetch Milos, she finds him missing. After a brief search, she concludes he has left the camp entirely. Ziva tries to contact him with a *Sending* spell, but it fails, stirring her deepest fears. The only times such magic failed were when the recipient was beyond the Mists—or dead.

The party decides to postpone reading the Tome and sets out to search for Milos. Sally takes the form of a direwolf, leading the group by tracking his scent. The trail leads them east, toward the Village of Barovia, where the mists grow heavier.

The group reaches a clearing, where red-eyed direwolves emerge from the fog, snarling and baring their teeth. Behind them steps a slender woman with disheveled black hair and a skull mask adorned with golden horns and sharp teeth. Her glowing red eyes and extended fangs betray her vampiric nature.

She exudes wild, unhinged energy, barely restraining her predatory urges. She informs the party that Milos will return but warns them not to take another step. If they do, she will take it as an invitation to attack.

Ziva tries to reason with her, but the woman’s composure frays, her snarls growing more feral. Recognizing the danger, the party reluctantly turns back, retreating toward the safety of the camp. 

The party retreats to the Vistani camp after their fruitless search for Milos, but tension mounts as Sally and Tian detect the distant sounds of wolves. They alert the group, and within moments, the party is encircled by the direwolves that accompanied the vampire woman we met before. In her direwolf form, Sally deciphers the growls of the pack. The wolves are under orders to kill but are unsettled, noting the absence of the woman and the alphas—a rare occurrence. Sally quickly deduces that the woman likely orchestrated this attack, relishing the hunt while keeping her distance.

The wolves launch their assault, and the party fights back fiercely. During the skirmish, Muriel, in her raven form, reveals herself, offering much-needed assistance with her dexterous and combat-hardened skills. Together, the party eliminates the direwolves. After the battle, Muriel warns them of another approaching pack. She had been following the group to deliver this message, though her demeanor remains cold.

Muriel identifies the mysterious woman the party encountered earlier as Volenta Popofsky, one of Strahd’s brides. She explains that Volenta holds dominion over the wolves and other forest creatures, granting her an omnipresent gaze within the woods. The party, heeding her warning, resumes its trek to the camp.

Before reentering the camp, the party continues to plead their case to Muriel, seeking a second chance to earn her trust. Her skepticism runs deep, rooted in the betrayal and pain the Keepers of the Feather endured—most notably the death of Urwin’s son, Bray. Muriel recounts how Urwin’s misplaced trust in outsiders has repeatedly led to personal tragedy. She is adamant that the Keepers, a secretive and traditional sect, will not offer aid, especially after their recent displacement from the Wizard of the Wines by a group of druids.

Ziva offers information as a potential bargaining tool, arguing that knowledge could hold great value to the Keepers, but Muriel dismisses this, deeming it insufficient. She questions Tian directly, probing why Urwin trusted him and what set him apart. When Tian falters in his response, Ziva steps in, pointing out a striking resemblance between Tian and Urwin. This observation momentarily unsettles Muriel, though she quickly masks her emotions.

The conversation shifts back to the Keepers’ plight. Muriel reveals that the druids’ new leader, an older woman with white hair and a menacing aura, is none other than Lysaga. Though initially surprised by the party’s familiarity with this name, Muriel acknowledges their knowledge but remains wary of their intentions. She suggests that reclaiming the Wizard of the Wines might earn the Keepers’ attention, though even that may not suffice to fully repair the fractured trust.

As Muriel prepares to leave, Ziva appeals to her revolutionary spirit, emphasizing the urgency of uniting against Strahd. Sally, as a gesture of goodwill, tosses Muriel a Sending Stone, offering her a direct line of communication. Muriel takes it but remains noncommittal, transforming into a raven and vanishing into the skies.

Shortly after Muriel’s departure, Milos returns atop Moonshade, bristling with anger. He curtly informs the party that he visited Ravenloft to seek Strahd’s assistance in brewing the potion for Stella. When pressed about Strahd’s price, Milos reveals that Strahd asked for nothing in return, though his evasive tone hints at hidden truths. Milos lists the potion’s ingredients: a magical feather, a moonlit flower blessed in holy water (the Astell flower), and celestial blood. Sally is the only one capable of administering the potion correctly.

As the group continues back to camp, Ziva pulls Milos aside to apologize for her earlier attack on him with radiant magic. Though visibly uncomfortable, Milos accepts her apology and requests that she refrain from using such force against him in the future and awkwardly side hugs her.

Meanwhile, Sally broaches the possibility of Ireena possessing latent magical abilities. Ireena dismisses the idea, citing her lack of demonstrated aptitude, but the conversation lingers in the air. Upon Milos’s arrival at the camp, Arabelle confronts him about Moonshade’s absence, whispering pointedly that she knows where he has been.

With the party reassembled, they begin reading the newly deciphered chapter of the Tome of Strahd, entering the section titled *Love*. The chapter, *Tatyana*, unfolds with Strahd’s voice lamenting his envy of Sergei’s youth and beauty. The tone softens as Strahd recounts seeing Tatyana for the first time, her beauty unmatched and captivating.

The scene shifts to the balcony of Castle Ravenloft, where an argument erupts. Markovia, red-faced with fury, confronts Strahd over a gruesome act—he has killed someone and displayed their severed head above the castle’s entrance. She denounces the act as blasphemy before cursing him and storming away at his cold dismissal.

Rahadin appears, reporting that the consolidation of power among the noble families is proceeding as planned, though he voices concerns about the potential threat of their growing influence. Strahd, ever confident, assures him that contingencies are in place to maintain their loyalty.

Their attention turns to Sergei, seen leaving the castle for the village below. Strahd, intrigued, learns from Rahadin that Sergei has been meeting with a woman in secret. A wicked smile crosses Strahd’s face as he remarks upon the fact that his brother, in the position of Dawnmaster, is sworn to celibacy. He devises a plan: a grand dinner at Ravenloft, where Sergei and his mysterious companion will be the center of attention.

The narrative brings the party to a vision of the grand dining hall of Ravenloft, transformed for a lavish feast. To Tian, this scene starkly contrasts the foreboding atmosphere he once experienced during his own dinner with Strahd. The table is richly adorned, but the background motion and sounds are distant and muted, as though viewed through a veil.

The group sees the table and its occupants: Strahd, Patrina, a dusk elf woman and sister to Kazimir, Rahadin, countess Dorfniya, Sergei and the spitting image of Ireena: Tatyana. The group watches the meal uniform as ghostly apparitions, but they can influence the discussions to a certain extent

The party observes the lavish feast within Ravenloft’s dining hall, its opulence a stark contrast to the grim circumstances surrounding its host. Strahd recounts to Tatyana the loss of his parents, a revelation that prompts Sergei to interject. Sergei admits he never realized Strahd harbored such feelings, as his brother had always been distant. Strahd ignores Sergei, directing his attention back to Tatyana. He warmly invites her to visit Ravenloft whenever she pleases and inquires about her aspirations. Tatyana expresses her desire for a simple life of purpose, dedicated to uplifting the village.

Her comment draws sneers from the noble attendees, but she counters firmly, declaring that simplicity can carry profound meaning. Strahd agrees, though his clenched jaw reveals inner turmoil as he acknowledges the obvious connection between Sergei and Tatyana. It is clear to the party that, while not physically present, they can subtly influence the unfolding events.

When asked about their meeting, Tatyana shyly recounts that Sergei had visited her village during his arrival in Barovia, and they had been close ever since. Strahd seizes the opportunity to remind Sergei of his celibacy vow as the newly named Dawnmaster. Tatyana reacts with disappointment but quickly composes herself. Throughout the meal, Strahd continues to undermine Sergei with veiled jabs, which Sergei fails to grasp. Tatyana valiantly defends him, though Strahd’s relentless verbal sparring persists.

As the dinner progresses, Sergei thanks Strahd for his sacrifices, praising his role in shaping a better life for others. Tatyana, however, grows increasingly uneasy under Strahd’s intense focus, though she maintains polite decorum. When Lady Patrina invites Strahd to dance, he declines gracefully. Suggestions for Rahadin to escort Patrina lead to an angry outburst, with Rahadin’s disdain for her earning a sharp reprimand from Strahd.

The party gleans insight into the political landscape of Barovia. The Dilisnya family has relocated, with Countess Dorfniya’s four grown children: Rinehold Dilisnya, Gertrude Dilisnya, Oleka Dilisnya (married Victor Wachter, producing a daughter: Lovina Wachter) and Leo Dilisnya, now central figures. Mention of Oleka’s husband, Victor Wachter, elicits visible disgust from the Countess. Patrina, meanwhile, serves as Strahd’s confidante, aiding in his exploration of the castle’s tunnels and his study of the arcane arts (though the group suspects that she is also helping him research the Dark Powers). The castle’s foundation, built atop the ruins of an ancient barbarian settlement, ruled by Droston, adds another layer of intrigue.

Markovia’s departure from Ravenloft lingers as a point of interest for Strahd. Her decision to leave followed her outrage over Argynvost’s skull being mounted at the castle entrance. Strahd has tasked Alek Gwillym with investigating disturbances at Argynvostholt, where the spirits of the dead seem unsettled.

Encouraged by the party, Sergei asks Tatyana to dance. Though hesitant, she agrees, and their budding affection becomes evident as they share shy smiles and whispered exchanges. Strahd watches them intently, his longing undisguised. Tatyana mentions feeling out of place among the nobility, a sentiment Sergei shares. Their bond grows as they move in harmony, oblivious to Strahd’s gaze.

Countess Dorfniya remarks on Tatyana’s low birth, prompting Strahd to admonish her. He asserts that noble blood holds no value without virtue. When the topic of Barovia’s old gods arises, Strahd dismisses the notion with a sharp retort, his avoidance suspicious. Patrina observes his reaction carefully, hinting at deeper secrets.

The conversation shifts to the Village of Barovia, where Tatyana questions Strahd about leadership. She mentions Indir Kolyanovich, the elected burgomaster, and Strahd formally endorses Indir, valuing capability over noble lineage. Tatyana excuses herself, claiming the late hour, and Strahd insists she stay at the castle. Despite her initial protest, she agrees, her radiant smile directed at Sergei. Strahd’s disappointment flickers briefly before the scene dissolves.

Time shifts, and the party finds Strahd and Tatyana strolling the castle courtyard. Her longer hair and refined attire signal the passage of time. She appears comfortable in his presence, though her questions probe his guarded nature. Strahd admits the burden of his emotional walls but remains reluctant to lower them.

Tatyana, with playful determination, challenges him to carry a bucket of manure using only his pinky. Strahd struggles but refuses to concede. She urges him to share the burden, and eventually, he relents. Together, they complete the task, forging a connection that deepens Strahd’s growing affection.

The scene transitions to Strahd and Tatyana in the reading room. Strahd plays the harp, his music enchanting her. He begins to sing, his voice unexpectedly beautiful, and Tatyana joins him, creating an intimate moment. Sergei interrupts, and Tatyana rushes to greet him, her joy palpable. He lifts her in a jubilant embrace, spinning her in his arms.

Her happiness falters as she notices Strahd’s expression. A flicker of jealousy mars his composure, and Tatyana’s elation dims, replaced by guilt. It is clear she feels the weight of Strahd’s unspoken affection, a sentiment she cannot return due to her love for Sergei. The party senses the tangled emotions simmering beneath the surface as the scene fades again into obscurity.

The party awakens from the vision, each member silently grappling with its revelations. Ireena struggles to process what she has seen, unsure what to make of Strahd’s humanity in the vision. Milos reveals that during Sergei and Tatyana’s dance, he experienced a vision of his own past.

Ireena admits her difficulty reconciling the Strahd from the vision—a man who seemed almost human—with the monster she knows him to be. Ziva gently reminds her that Strahd was human once, and though he is loathed now, that does not erase the person he used to be. Tian reflects on his own dinner with Strahd, mentioning that Strahd had seemed intrigued by Milos’s desire to change. Milos, angered that Tian shared personal details with Strahd, storms out of the tent.

Ziva turns to Ireena, asking how the visions affected her. Ireena confesses she could feel Tatyana’s happiness with Sergei and holds no judgment for Tatyana’s efforts to help Strahd. She notes, however, that the Tome of Strahd represents his perspective—potentially painting himself in a favorable light. Memories, she reflects, are subjective, making Strahd an unreliable narrator of his own story. Ziva proposes that Sergei’s death may not have been natural, planting a seed of suspicion.

Milos seeks out Madame Eva, hoping for answers about his vampirism and its connection to Strahd’s plans. Conflicted and burdened, he describes Strahd’s smug attitude toward him. Eva, ever insightful, explains that Strahd is typically calculated and rarely boastful, making his demeanor unusual.

Milos asks if he can rid himself of vampirism, but Eva admits she knows of no way to undo it. She shares a sobering truth: Strahd has erased everything but his anger, leaving him uncertain of his own identity. To recover his memories, Milos must confront Strahd directly. Though he doubts his survival, Milos expresses a desire to forge a better path. Eva encourages him to focus on creating meaningful memories in the present, even if he cannot reclaim the past.

Around the fire, Sally introduces herself to two new Vistani travelers, Eliza and Arturi. Eliza’s outgoing nature contrasts with Arturi’s reserved demeanor. The pair, having met on the road, share plans to travel beyond the Mists. Ziva persuades them to take a letter to her parents in Red Larch, east of Waterdeep. During their conversation, Ziva mentions Arrigal, and Sally accidentally reveals that Arrigal is Ziva’s uncle.

The newcomers divulge intriguing details. Strange events plague Markovia’s Abbey, and the abbot there exudes a disturbing presence. The Wizard of the Wines winery thrived due to magical grapes, once under the protection of Dimitri Krezkov. Now, the gates of Krezk remain shut by order of the burgomaster, denying entry to outsiders.

Arturi probes whether the party has encountered van Richten. Milos, sensing that Arturi knows more than he reveals, alerts Ziva to question him later. Meanwhile, Arabelle proposes a Game of Stories, sparking excitement among the gathered Vistani. Items are added to the pot, and storytellers take turns sharing tales—true, half-true, or false. Participants guess the nature of each story, earning points for correct guesses. Milos ultimately wins the pot.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eliza’s Story:

*“It is said that within each raven flutters a lost soul, and that each raven’s song tells a tale of ages past. They whisper, so listen closely.*

*She takes a deep breath; when she speaks again, her voice is quiet, with an eerie, melodic quality to it.*

*Sing, ravens, of Barovia, birthed from the mists and bathed in twilight. Sing of Lugdana, the Morninglord’s stalwart, dawn-touched foe to the deep-lurking dark. The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, her radiant testament, the warrior’s beacon of faithful resolve.*

*Sing, ravens, of Chernovog’s rise, named Green-God and Demon-Lord upon Yester Hill. Lugdana, gray-haired, weary of battle, her longsword and shield yet polished and ready. Guided through shadows, toward sacred ground, she clashed with the demon, their tempest-like dance.*

*Sing, ravens, of Lugdana’s last fury, of Ravenkind’s token now blazing with light. The battle’s tide turning, a hero’s brave cry, a final onslaught with divinity’s grace. The Demon-Lord banished, the warrior now fell, the wound at her side gouged too deep to bear.*

*Sing, ravens, of light’s final moments, a shadow descending from radiance on high. Sing of the angel, black-feathered and beaked, the Morninglord’s angel reclaiming its gift. The Symbol retaken, in ravens’ claws held.*

*Sing, ravens; you are the keepers, the watchers, the tellers of stories untold. Sing, ravens, of Lugdana’s memory, the shadows that lurk, and heroes to come.”*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arturi’s Story:

*“There was once a silver Fox, renowned among all for his curative touch. On a cold, moonlit night, however, a rustle of wings disturbed his peaceful reprieve. A flock of Sparrows brought him one of their own, the tendrils of Death clutching its small, shivering body. The Silver Fox took the sickly sparrow into his den, but with all his wisdom and skill, he could not cure its ailment, and it breathed its last in his paws.*

*Fearing the Sparrows’ anger, the Fox begged them to take anything in exchange for peace. The Sparrows, hearts filled with grief, departed into the moonlit night. It was only at dawn that the Fox realized what they had taken: His beloved kit had vanished, taken by the Sparrows’ claws.*

*The Fox pursued the sparrows through barren lands and shadowed woods. He found them slumbering amidst the branches of a gnarled tree—and, in his cleverness, snatched two of their flock in the jaws of his teeth.*

*‘Where is my kit?’ the silver Fox roared. The Sparrows, now prey in his claws, shared the terrible truth: they had given his kit to the Kingdom of Night, where the cursed Sovereign of Dusk dwelled in the darkness.*

*And so the Fox passed from light into dark, his legs aching and sore, his paws bramble-pricked and bloody. It was in the keep of Dusk’s Sovereign that he found his lost quarry—and uncovered his kit’s dreadful fate. His kit now shared the Sovereign’s curse, the features of life now twisted and warped, his once-lively eyes now deadened and cold.*

*The kit begged for reprieve—for his father to free him from his cursed existence. And the silver Fox, with a heart heavier than the mountains, with eyes stinging with tears, did the unthinkable—and ended his kit’s torment. As the Fox’s anguished howl shattered the night, so, too, did his heart. A father had entered the Kingdom that day, but it was a phantom, born of anguish and rage, that vanished into the shrouded night.”*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stanimir’s Story:

*Some years back, when I was still a young man with a full head of hair, I was to help my cousin Babik get to the small house he had just bought near Luna Lake. The trip was long, and we would be spending many days within the woods with no road to guide us, so I thought it best to ask my brothers and sisters to join us. On our first day in the woods we paid no heed to the stories our parents had told us of the mists and the tricks it can play on you. We were young \- strong. We thought we would be more than capable of handling everything on our own.* 

*So as the sun went down, we set up our tents and built a campfire for the night. The forest grew dark around us, and drinking had made us bold. My brother, Pontius, had drunk too much and went to relieve himself in the woods. Several minutes passed, then nearly an hour as we sat by the fire, drinking and roasting game. Pontius never came back.*

*In the morning as we began to pack and gather our belongings, we noticed that Pontius’ belongings were gone. When I asked our group where he went, one said that they had seen him come back in the middle of the night, shaking like he was laughing without making a sound, and that he had gathered his things and left. I assumed that he had simply decided to scout out the path ahead, as Pontius was always one to forge his own way through the world, and figured we would run into him up ahead.*

*And so we continued into the woods, drinking and laughing and thinking that we were invincible. After several hours of walking though one of the women in our group shouted that someone was following us. I looked back to where she was pointing, and indeed saw that we were being followed. I saw my brother’s head, and his wide playful smile peering out at us from behind a tree. “Oh, it’s just Pontius,” I told her. And I ran over to meet him, but before I could he vanished behind the tree and I could hear him run off into the woods.*

*I was no stranger to his games like this. Any Vistana can tell you that we pride ourselves on being nimble and stealthy, impossible to catch. I looked forward to this game, even, hoping to prove to my brother that I was the superior one. We saw him many times after that \- poking out from behind trees and bushes, all with that same big smile. But I was never fast enough to catch him.* 

*Days passed like this. By the third night we had all grown worried over Pontius, as he hadn’t been joining us for meals or to refill our waterskins, or even to sleep. His games often lasted long, but never like this before. And that night when I laid down to sleep, I stared out into the woods at the distant shape of my brother’s head, peering out at me from behind a gnarled tree trunk. This time I did not run to catch him. I laid there for what seemed like hours, watching as his head poked out from different spots in the forest. And as I did, ice grew thick in my veins. Because I noticed that since this game had started, his expression had never changed. And his eyes had never blinked.* 

*I don’t know when I fell asleep, but eventually I woke in the morning to someone shaking me and telling me that another had run off into the woods. After that we didn’t drink or laugh while we walked. We barely even talked. When Alamina joined Pontius in staring at us from within the woods no one said anything. The fighters of our group simply loaded our crossbows, and listened for any approaching footsteps.* 

*Each night someone else would disappear from our group. Even if we all sat awake, watching one another to make sure no one could leave, eventually sleep would wash over us \- and in the morning our number would be one fewer. As our group shrank, the people we saw in the woods began to grow. Eventually all that remained was me, Babik, and three others.* 

*On that last day as Babik’s house came into view we all ran to the door and locked ourselves inside. For the first time in nearly a week we felt safe behind the strong walls of the house. Again, we ate and we drank and laughed, trying to forget those who lurked out in the forest. And when the drink ran dry, we all fell asleep huddled together on Babik’s new bed.* 

*At some point in the night though, I woke to the sound of the door to the bedroom opening. Pontius stood in the doorframe. I could tell it was him by the way that the candlelight in the hall behind him lit up his hair, which he had always prided himself on being able to comb into large spikes. But something about the way he stood seemed wrong. He was too short, too skinny, and he walked with a limp as he shuffled over to the side of the bed. I could see him shaking, making that same strange soundless laugh that he had been seen doing the night his game began.* 

*And then he reached up and grabbed at something just underneath the collar of his shirt. I couldn’t tell what he was doing at first, but slowly I realized that he was lifting something off of himself. Bit by bit the skin of his neck peeled back like leather. His face, still stuck in that unblinking smile, began to deform, wrinkling and falling in on itself until I could see the mask come off entirely. And I am thankful that it was too dark for me to see whatever was underneath. To see whatever laughed silently, watching my fear, and to see whatever it was that slinked out of my room with my brother’s face in its hands.* 

*It’s been many years since then, but even now when I look out into the woods I can still see my brother’s face behind the trees, shaking as whatever’s beneath it laughs.*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ireena’s Story

*"When I was a child, my father took me and my brother to a vast, tranquil lake. I remember the sand beneath my bare feet, and the lapping of the waves against the shore.*

*But then, something broke the silence—a low growl that echoed through the wind. As I turned, I saw a beast emerge from the fog: a wolf, far larger than any I'd ever seen. I still remember its eyes—yellow, cold, and hungry.*

*My father screamed for me to run. I took off for the woods, and the wolf followed, its snarls echoing through the underbrush. I remember branches whipping against my face, thorns cutting at my feet as my legs burned and my breath grew ragged, but my fear drove me forward.*

*It was only much later, when my heart had quieted in my chest and the wolf's footsteps had faded into silence, that I finally allowed myself to stop. By then, though, the woods were strange to me, and my father's shouts had faded.*

*A heavy mist had descended around me, and shadowed shapes lurked in every corner. I stepped forward, one hand reaching fearfully into the fog—and a wolf made of mist leapt forth, its jaws opened wide to devour me. And then—everything went black.*

*The next thing I remembered, I awoke in my own bed, my father's humming echoing from the kitchen. I don't know how I got there, or what became of the wolf, but I can still remember its teeth as clearly as ever."*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ziva identifies Arturi’s tale as the tragic story of van Richten and his son Erasmus, stolen by Vistani and sold to Strahd. Strahd turned Erasmus into a vampire, forcing van Richten to slay his son to end his suffering.

After the game, Ziva questions Arturi further. Arturi reluctantly admits his family, the Radonavichs, played a role in Erasmus’s kidnapping, alongside the Davenir family. He reveals that van Richten’s retaliation brought night creatures to their Vistani camp, an attack that led to Ziva’s disappearance. Yet from this tragedy came a bond: van Richten took Ezmeralda, a young Vistani girl and Ziva’s childhood friend, as his apprentice. Arturi shares that van Richten eventually sought redemption for his sins.

Milos approaches Ireena, confessing that he remembers nothing of his youth. Ireena, taken aback, had always assumed he was indifferent. Resolving to help him, she offers to share stories from their childhood, a small step toward rebuilding what was lost.

Later in the evening, the party gathers in the covered pool (the *“cī́u-bår”* in the Draconic Language) created by Ziva, preparing for a moment of camaraderie. 

As Milos prepares to hotbox the cī́u-bår with a dose of Vistana’s coochie, Arabelle jumps in, unabashedly joining the party. The group convinces her to leave, but only after she demands a bribe for cutting her revelry short. Milos offers her either the \+1 sword (from Tian) or the wand (from Ziva) he won during the Story Circle contest. Arabelle chooses the sword, leaving the cī́u-bår reluctantly but satisfied.

With her departure, Milos throws the entire dose into his flail, and the effects hit hard. The party descends into vivid, surreal hallucinations.

Ireena leans her head back, tears slipping from her closed eyes. She weeps softly, her sadness quiet and profound.

Ziva’s gaze roves over the others with an inappropriate curiosity before she begins to float in the water. Her mind drifts back to the night shadow creatures attacked the Vistani camp twenty years ago. In her altered state, she sees the creatures—zombie-like figures—relentlessly assaulting Ezmeralda’s home as Luvash pulls her away. She wonders where her mother is. On a distant hill, she spots van Richten commanding the creatures. Around his head shimmers a strange aura, reminiscent of the curse Arabelle placed on Bluto. The vision abruptly ends, and Ziva attempts to cast **Sending** repeatedly to reach van Richten. Though the spell connects, no response comes.

Milos suffers a visceral and tormenting trip. He finds himself on the cliffs of Ravenloft, watching familiar faces plummet from the battlements to their deaths. When his father, Laszlo, begins to fall, Milos reaches for him, but Laszlo hesitates before pulling back, choosing death over life. Milos sees Ireena falling, only to realize it is Tatyana, her expression heavy with sorrow. She too seems to embrace the fall, choosing an end to her suffering.

Sally hallucinates herself running through Barovia’s open fields, hand in hand with Ireena. Suddenly, Ireena floats away, the sky darkens, and the land withers around her. Voices echo, anguished and pleading: *“Look to the ladies, you, purifier of lands. Only you can heal us. Find us\!”* Desperate, Sally tries to cast a healing spell, but it fails, the flower she conjures withering into rot. The voices call from three distinct places: a blood-soaked location near the Bonegrinder Mill, the fertile lands of the Wizard of the Wines, and a ruin to the south.

Tian’s trip brings self-reflection. He confronts his shortcomings and feels the weight of his failures. In his vision, he runs through a forest and is tapped on the head by his uncle, a skilled aarakocra martial artist. Sparring begins, his uncle outmatching him with ease while offering wisdom. Tian’s uncle challenges him to embrace his responsibilities and cultivate self-belief, warning him not to chase the wrong goals. Strength, his uncle says, comes not from brute force but from wisdom and understanding. *“Don’t chase the wrong things. Losing a fight is not a sign of being weak. Remember that these moments teach you something. The day you don’t get pinned down and the day you won’t lose anymore is the day you’re dead.”*  he concludes, leaving Tian with clarity and resolve.

As the hallucinations fade, Milos, still under the drug’s influence, proposes marriage to everyone in the cī́u-bår. Sally, imagining herself marrying Ireena, accepts. Amid laughter and confusion, Milos officiates the ceremony. The group cheers in celebration as Milos blesses the water in the cī́u-bår, turning it into holy water.

The act has unintended consequences. Submerged in the now-holy water, Milos begins to burn, his vampiric nature reacting violently. He narrowly escapes, running into the woods, where he finds a squirrel to drain repeatedly, healing it each time to prolong his survival.

The party gradually stirs, nursing headaches as they head to the lake to clean off the previous night’s chaos. The camp is abuzz with stories of the noise and ruckus caused during their revelry. Milos joins the group at the lake, where Ziva teasingly asks if the newlyweds feel any different. Milos and Sally realize they were married during their drug-fueled haze.

A flurry of memories returns. Milos recalls attempting to marry Ziva during the ceremony, though for reasons unknown, the ritual failed. Ziva laughs it off, attributing the failure to a mistake in the process. Under questioning, she admits to a drunken, high Feywild *“wedding”* with Galdran years ago, officiated by a faun. When a second attempt to marry her fails, Ziva panics, realizing the Feywild ceremony may have been binding. Panicked, she storms away, trying and failing to contact Galdran through **Sending**, as Galdran is not in Barovia, but back in Waterdeep.

As the party prepares to leave, Araja and Ireena inform Milos and Sally about Barovian wedding traditions. Sally must gift Milos a sword, while Milos is tasked with sewing Sally a dress. Privately, Milos assures Sally they need not remain married if she does not wish to. Sally admits her hallucination led her to believe she was marrying Ireena. Milos gently urges her to share her feelings with Ireena, but Sally deflects, uncertain of Ireena’s affections.

Milos begins crafting a green dress with help from the Vistani women, while Sally acquires a sword, engraving it with care.

Before departing, Sally tries to teach Ireena magic, though Ireena struggles to grasp the lessons. Tian fares slightly better, sensing a pulse of life in Sally’s magic. Though unable to fully channel it, he feels a spark of progress, a faint glimpse of potential yet to be realized.

Ziva notices Stanimir nursing a massive hangover and approaches him, intent on learning more about Eliza, the Vistana to whom she gave a letter for her parents the previous night. Stanimir explains that Eliza is a *Remanio*—a Vistana who has abandoned her tribe and way of life, severing her ties with her people. In the eyes of the Vistani, a *Remanio* is effectively dead, distinct from a *Mortu*, who is an outcast forcibly exiled by the tribe. The *Remanios* are believed to be cut from the threads of fate itself. Though Ziva presses for more details, Stanimir refuses to gossip further.

Ziva bids him goodbye and notices Arabelle playing with two cats at the edge of the woods. She approaches and learns the cats belong to Eva, who has named them Zelda and Alain. Ziva is startled—these are the names of her adoptive parents. Troubled by the coincidence, she resolves to discuss it with Eva later. Milos soon joins them, making pointed remarks about Ziva’s decision to spend time with the cats.

Sally is engrossed in her work at the Vistani blacksmithy, attempting to engrave an old sword as her wedding gift to Milos. The elderly blacksmith teaches her the craft, rebuffing her attempts to hasten the process with magic. Recognizing her connection to the land as a druid, the blacksmith shares the legend of the Rozonas, the Ladies Three of Barovia, and their domains:

* **Birth, Family, Love**  
* **Hunting, War, Passion**  
* **Foresight, Harvest, Wisdom**

Tian, practicing his magic to move a pile of leaves, achieves little success before noticing movement in the forest. A hooded figure stands 150 feet away, silently beckoning him closer. Tian cautiously approaches and discovers the figure is Arrigal. Arrigal requests that Tian fetch Ziva and meet him deeper in the forest.

Tian finds Ziva, and together they slip away to meet Arrigal. Meanwhile, Milos informs Sally of the encounter. Sally, not trusting Ziva one bit, transforms into an owl and follows them from above. Milos grabs Arabelle and uses his vampiric powers to traverse the trees, following from a distance.

Ziva and Tian meet Arrigal while the rest of the party observes from the shadows. Arrigal shares valuable information. Having heard whispers of the party's actions, he offers assistance but warns he is now a target and constantly on the move. He reveals that one of Strahd’s consorts is a traitor. Strahd has three consorts: Ludmilla, Volenta, and Anastrasya—the last being the most dangerous of them all. Arrigal hints at his own former involvement with Strahd, disclosing that the traitor assured him his secrets are safe with her.

He also warns that Vallaki has grown darker and more oppressive under Wachter’s control. Wachter promotes a cult-like devotion to Strahd, manipulating information and pushing for the town’s submission. Finally, he insists that taking Arabelle to the castle for dinner is far too dangerous. He bids the party to be cautious and promises to help where he can before disappearing into the woods.

Sally tracks him briefly but abandons the pursuit after ten minutes. Milos and Arabelle descend from the trees, questioning Ziva and Tian about their meeting. Ziva carefully convinces Arabelle that the man was an informant whose identity must remain secret, sparing Arabelle the pain of realizing her favorite uncle didn’t seek her out.

The party reconvenes and finds Ireena, who has spent the morning speaking with Eva. Ziva and Tian share the information learned from Arrigal, prompting a discussion about their next steps. Ziva raises several important points:

* After speaking with Arturi Radanovich about van Richten’s son and the Vistani camp’s destruction, Ziva has deduced that the wandering Vistana mentioned in Eva’s initial reading–**The Mists Card**, seeking her master is her childhood best friend, Ezmeralda.  
* Van Richten is alive; Ziva’s **Sending** spells successfully reached him while she was under the influence, though he did not respond.  
* The forest is no longer safe for open conversation, as Volenta controls the animals and uses them to spy for Strahd.  
* Some Vistani work for Strahd, necessitating caution in disclosing plans.  
* Confronting the situation at the Wizard of the Wines will likely involve Lysaga, the Mother of the Ancient, an action that could provoke Strahd to view the party as a serious threat. Attending the dinner invitation first may allow for better positioning.

The party begins preparing for the formal event, with Ireena overcome by emotion, quietly crying as she readies herself. Ziva enlists Milos to help convince Arabelle to stay behind, as she was not formally invited. Milos succeeds in persuading her, though Arabelle is clearly disappointed.

Dressed in their finest attire, the party steps into the road and accepts Strahd’s invitation. A black carriage drawn by two black horses appears. Inside, they find a puzzle box and a bottle of wine from the Wizard of the Wines. Solving the puzzle reveals an enchanted box with six compartments. Each contains a pair of dark velvet cloaks trimmed with white fur and matching black gloves, tailored to their individual preferences.

Riding in tense silence, the carriage brings them to the gates of the castle, where two shadowy figures stand waiting.

The two figures awaiting the party’s arrival are Rahadin and a strikingly beautiful woman dressed in red, adorned with a black and crimson headdress. Her crimson eyes betray her vampiric nature. The woman approaches with an elegant smile, addressing Tian by name as if they are already acquainted. Introducing herself as Anastrasya Karelovna, one of Strahd’s brides, her voice exudes control and sophistication. She addresses Rahadin as "Chamberlain" with an air of authority, though her demeanor clearly irritates him.

Rahadin, showing visible disdain, directs the carriage toward the northern side of the courtyard. Sally notices a shriveled figure emerge near the stables—a warped, chimeric being with animalistic features, such as a back-bent leg and wolf-like ears. The sight unsettles her.

With introductions concluded, the party proceeds inside, crossing the drawbridge. Above the castle entrance, a shattered piece of stained glass looms ominously. Memories flood Milos’s mind as he steps inside. Fragments of shadowy figures and flashes of the past overwhelm him—one man dragging another toward the castle. The vivid recollections leave him ravenously hungry.

Inside, the party ascends a secondary staircase guarded by two figures. One is Escher, a nonchalant man with an air of boredom. Beside him stands a pale woman with fine black hair and sharp fangs, wearing a tattered wedding gown. Her gaze lingers on the group before she freezes at the sight of Ireena, as though seeing a ghost.

Anastrasya introduces her with a mocking tone as Sasha, Strahd’s oldest bride. Escher regards Ireena with disdain, his nonchalance briefly replaced by contempt.

Further inside the great hall, two more figures await: a woman in a gold wedding dress and a skull mask, sipping from a goblet—Volenta Popofsky—and a dark-skinned woman who surveys the group with icy disdain, sneering at Ziva—Ludmilla Vasillievich.

The castle itself is both grand and decrepit, its imposing architecture marred by neglect. Cobwebs cling to corners, and a palpable air of decay hangs heavy. Volenta eyes Milos with disgust as he sways slightly, sweating profusely. Anastrasya, ever poised, directs a veiled insult at Sasha, whose restrained reaction manifests in bloodied palms as her nails dig into her fists.

Volenta whispers to Ludmilla, referring to Milos: “It seems our boy hasn’t changed much.”

Milos, struggling with his hunger, requests a drink. A servant named Anton approaches with two pitchers, one filled with wine and the other with blood.

Anastrasya inquires about the party’s plans, expressing delight at the entertainment their actions have brought to Barovia. Ziva admits the party seeks to resolve loose ends, starting with Morgantha. Anastrasya, dismissive, notes that not all creatures align with Strahd’s will. Morgantha, now westward and seeking a new coven, poses no real threat and need not be dealt with.

When asked about Vallaki’s current leadership, the consorts take the opportunity to mock Ludmilla’s failures in the city. They recall Lady Wachter visiting the castle long ago but admit they paid her little attention.

As the conversation unfolds, Anton, trembling with fear, stumbles and spills the red wine-blood mixture onto Volenta. Her reaction is immediate and violent. She shatters her goblet and turns on Anton with murderous intent. Despite the party’s protests, Volenta prepares to strike, only for Strahd to intervene.

Strahd, his voice commanding, reminds Volenta of the guests’ presence and the need for decorum. He orders Sasha to clean the mess and calls for another volunteer. None of the consorts step forward, so Milos takes up the task. Sally, meanwhile, heals Anton’s wounds, earning a rare commendation from Strahd.

Milos accompanies Sasha to fetch mops, and as they walk, she asks why he chose to help her. Milos admits he wished for respite from the tension and despised the way the others treated her. Sasha reveals she has spent centuries confined to her coffin, falling out of favor with Strahd and the other consorts.

Passing the kitchen, Milos is struck by the sight of a grand feast being prepared by another chimeric figure, a grotesque blend of human and animal parts. Sasha warns him against wandering, noting that being caught alone in the castle could result in a slow, painful death.

Reaching the cellar, they find rows of wine casks and a horrifying sight: a woman hanging by her feet from the ceiling, her blood pooling into a bowl below. Sasha speaks with uncharacteristic softness, warning Milos to remember he is among monsters. Milos acknowledges her warning, admitting that he, too, is a monster. After some reflection, Sasha asks him to meet her in a secret room after the dinner.

They return with the mops and clean in silence.

Ziva seizes the opportunity to question Strahd about Milos’s memories. Strahd explains he erased them as an act of kindness, sparing Milos from despair and self-destruction. She also inquires about the wine shortage from the Wizard of the Wines. Strahd attributes it to the Free Folk, a group of druids led by a fascinating woman the party may encounter if they investigate. He admits some of the druids worship him as a god, though he considers them fools for doing so.

The party enters a lavishly decorated dining hall and takes their seats. Milos admits his hunger to Strahd, his words laced with hatred, and questions him further about his memories. Strahd reiterates his reasoning but expresses surprise at the speed with which Milos’s memories are returning.

During the meal, Strahd telepathically addresses each party member, offering them a choice. As he raises his glass in a toast, he invites them to signal their decision by drinking either the red or white wine before them.

One by one, the party—along with Ireena—drinks red wine. Only Ziva defies the unspoken expectation, choosing the white.

After the toast, Strahd locks his gaze on Ireena, her expression devoid of emotion as she stares back in defiance. The tension in the room hangs thick, broken only by Ziva seizing the momentary silence to make an unusual request. She seeks to trade her precious stones for diamond earrings, claiming it is to complete her ensemble. Strahd, ever perceptive, discerns a deeper motive and presses her for honesty. Ziva confesses that she requires diamonds to resurrect fallen allies. Amused, Strahd agrees to the trade—but not for the gems she offers.

He proposes a more personal price, instructing Ziva to alter one of the holy symbols tattooed on her hands. With deliberate precision, Ziva removes her glove to reveal the moon tattoo on her left hand. Using a knife, she modifies the design into a full circle so the tattoo now better represents Shar’s holy symbol, fulfilling Strahd’s demand in a way that skirts its spirit. Strahd dabs her wounded hand with a napkin, tasting her blood with a wicked amusement before promising her the earrings when she departs.

The atmosphere shifts as Strahd begins posing hypothetical scenarios, testing the party's beliefs on faith, leadership, and rebellion. His questions seem to prod at deeper truths, while Milos, plagued by flashes of violence and torture, struggles with a hunger that grows ever more consuming.

Strahd turns his attention to Ireena, asking if she has considered his proposal made in Vallaki. She acknowledges his question but reveals little. Strahd urges her to reflect on the root of all evil in Barovia.

Sally seizes the opportunity to ask about the haunting visions she experienced on the Svalich Road. Strahd appears genuinely unaware, claiming no involvement, but encourages her to seek understanding. Meanwhile, Milos directs the conversation toward Strahd's powers, particularly the mists and the recycling of souls. Strahd admits that the mists imprison him as much as they do others, describing Barovia as both his home and his prison. His curse is eternal, and he cannot die, even if he wished for it.

When Milos suggests searching for loopholes, Strahd chuckles darkly, admitting he does the same. A sudden anger flares as Strahd demands to know if his desire for freedom makes him a monster. Ireena concedes that it does not, though she declares her hatred for him nonetheless. Strahd cryptically hints that the party is the key to his freedom, though he remains uncertain how events will unfold.

The tension escalates when Milos confronts Strahd angrily about his memories. Strahd has enough of Milos’ outburst and despite claiming they cannot be restored, he seizes Milos by the head, and an arcane flash of blue light bursts forth. Memories crash into Milos like a tidal wave: scenes of battle, torture, and cruelty where he is not the victim but the perpetrator. He was once Strahd’s lieutenant, reveling in violence before remorse drove him to ask Strahd to erase his memories so he can start anew. The revelation leaves Milos shaken, yet he refuses Ziva's offer of respite.

Tian briefly shifts the focus, inquiring about the castle’s cook. Strahd dismisses the staff as inanimate relics of the past, trained by masters long gone. Ziva steers the conversation toward Lysaga, recounting visions of her in a hut. Strahd confirms the aggressor in the vision is indeed Lysaga, and the woman Lysaga has sacrificed was once a figure of power in this land akin to her. He expresses disdain for what she has done with the druids, now worshipping him as a god, and grants the party permission to deal with her as they see fit.

Ziva reveals the source of her knowledge about Lysaga: the previous owners of the Wizard of the Wines. Strahd’s smile sharpens as he acknowledges the Keepers of the Feather’s existence, remarking that they once amused him but have since grown tiresome.

When Tian asks about Argynvostholt and its revenants, Strahd grows cryptic, intrigued by the name but offering no elaboration. Another round of philosophical exchanges follows, with Strahd displaying a mixture of frustration and curiosity about the party's convictions and motives.

Sally brings up Vallaki, prompting Strahd to dismiss the town as irrelevant. He considers Fiona Wachter an improvement over Vargas, praising her intelligence but noting her internal struggles. When Ziva boldly mentions Wachter’s mysterious box of bones, Strahd grows intrigued, suggesting he might visit her personally. He speculates the bones might belong to Leo Dilisnya, hinting at a deeper connection.

Finally, Strahd proposes an exercise in trust, asking each member of the party to reveal something personal.

### **Tian**

Tian confesses that when he died and Ziva resurrected him, a fragment of his soul was replaced by another’s. Ziva expresses regret for being unable to fully restore his essence, but Tian reassures her, valuing the life he was given over what was lost.

### **Sally**

Sally reveals her fear of Ziva and the dark presence within her. She worries about what Ziva might do under the influence of Shar.

### **Ziva**

Ziva admits her own fears: that Sally might one day kill her out of suspicion. She discloses a critical truth—she struck a deal with Shar upon her death, uncertain of its full terms but knowing it was the only way to survive.

The tension between Sally and Ziva begins to unravel. Sally urges Ziva to see things from her perspective: Shar destroyed her entire village and killed her mother, and now a part of that goddess resides in Ziva. Ziva counters by asserting that Shar’s influence is no greater than the Morninglord’s presence in her life. She acknowledges the devastation Shar caused but insists she bears no guilt for it. She challenges Sally to consider her perspective: she doesn’t know why Shar has taken an interest in her, but she strives to live despite the stigma and hostility this brings.

Sally recalls the man Ziva killed in Vallaki and questions whether it was Ziva or Shar who guided her actions. She fears Shar might someday use Ziva to harm the group. Ziva admits that, though she wishes otherwise, she was entirely in control during that incident. She recognizes her past self was not a good person and cannot guarantee such actions won’t happen again. While Shar may have encouraged her, her choices were her own.

Strahd interjects, confirming that Ziva acted of her own volition and urging the party to judge her by her actions, not assumptions about Shar’s influence.

### **Milos**

Milos states he has no secrets left to reveal; the party already knows all there is to know about him. He admits that Ireena is the only one he truly trusts, as she sees something in him even he cannot. The rest of the group, he views merely as tools—useful until they are not. Ziva astutely points this out, and Milos acknowledges it without hesitation. In another time and place, he concedes, they might have been friends, but in this reality, he will not hesitate to eliminate any of them if they stand in his way.

### **Ireena**

Ireena confesses that Strahd’s words in Vallaki left a deeper mark than she initially let on. Since then, she has spoken with him on more occasions and is now considering joining him willingly.

The revelations lay bare the fractured bonds within the group, even as Strahd watches with quiet satisfaction, a puppet master drawing the strings ever tighter.

Strahd begins by asking how many secrets the party believes it has kept from him. The answer, unspoken but clear, is that he likely knows everything. He assures the group they have not angered him—save for one matter: the ***Tome of Strahd***. He grants them seven more days with the book, after which they must willingly surrender it when one of his consorts comes to claim it.

Strahd recounts his slumber of 100 years, disturbed only when Milos and his allies stormed the gates of Castle Ravenloft. He offers the party a task: to apprehend one of Milos’s former companions. Though initially unable to recall, Milos eventually remembers the name ***Alannik***, also known as ***The Mage***. Strahd reveals that Milos did not orchestrate the attack alone and that several of his comrades remain in Strahd’s custody.

When Sally inquires about the fanes, Strahd describes them as ancient powers no longer connected to the land, though he admits to having dealt with them in the past. The party also asks if those within the castle, including his consorts, retain their free will. Strahd confirms that most sentient beings in Ravenloft do, though he notes that vampirism amplifies their most prominent personality traits.

Regarding Baba Lysaga, Strahd expresses indifference to her current activities, explaining that the druids she commands have sworn fealty to him. When Tian asks about the dark powers mentioned in the Tome by the dragon Argynvost, Strahd admits surprise that the party has delved that far into his writings. Though he now regrets granting them additional time with the book, he honors his promise. He warns, however, that the land holds evils beyond their understanding and that he will not make their quest for knowledge easy.

When Sally asks about Arabelle, Strahd reveals that she was once merely a concept to him. However, now that he knows her name, he is intrigued by the mysteries surrounding her and wishes to understand her better.

As the meal concludes, Strahd offers a tour of the castle. Milos, visibly shaken, requests to stay behind. Strahd allows it but warns him not to wander, reminding him that he is no longer a resident at the castle.

Strahd leads the way for the party and tells them of the castle. The castle, built over 400 years ago atop the ruins of an ancient fortress, was constructed in just 3–4 years by architects Khazan and Artimus. Time has not been kind to it; the structure is in disarray, neglected over centuries.

The tour leads the group to a pair of large wooden doors adorned with sun-shaped handles. The designs remind Ziva of Milos, though she cannot explain why. The doors open to reveal an ancient chapel of Ravenloft.

The chapel, consecrated long ago in the name of Lathander by Prefect Kiril, no longer bears any sign of the Morninglord. The altar, damaged but intact, is decorated with bas-reliefs of angelic figures. However, the air is thick with darkness, and the space no longer feels sacred.

When Sally asks about celestials, Strahd admits to having encountered some, noting that a few still reside in Barovia. He leads the group to a tapestry depicting his father wielding the Brightblade in battle. Strahd confidently declares that the sword is broken.

While the main group is on the tour, Milos, left alone, approaches the organ in the dining hall, pressing its sixth pedal. The instrument quakes and slides forward, revealing a hidden passage. Milos enters a small mirrored room with arrow slits overlooking the courtyard.

From above, a cloaked figure drops into view—**Sasha Ivliskova**, Strahd’s first bride. Exhausted and embittered, Sasha reveals her desire to see Strahd dead and the sun restored to Barovia. She explains that Strahd wed her after Tatyanna’s death but grew tired of her, locking her away in a crypt for 400 years. Recently freed but she doesn't know why.

When Milos asks if she is Arrigal’s informant, Sasha becomes distraught, explaining that Arrigal used to report to Anastrasya and provide Strahd with intelligence on the party. She once caught him eavesdropping but allowed him to leave; he has not returned since. She warns that Arrigal plays both sides and must be handled carefully.

Sasha offers information in exchange for help: she needs someone freed from the castle jail on the third floor. She advises acting during the new moon, when Strahd leaves the castle for two days. In his absence, patrols of wights enforce his will, and any trespassers are reported.

She also reveals a hidden entrance from the courtyard and mentions that Volenta keeps a chamber of bones in the basement, which supposedly contains Argynvost’s dragon skull. She shares a potential passphrase for secret doors: *“I come in Droston’s memory.”*

Concluding their talk, Sasha departs and Milos resets the organ and waits to be summoned.

As the tour concludes, Strahd calls a bat from the rafters and sends it to summon Escher, instructing him to bring Milos to the audience chamber.

Escher bursts into the hall where Milos waits, hurling him across the table in anger. Furious about Ireena’s presence, Escher accuses the party of breaking their deal. Milos addresses him as *brother* and insists that Ireena’s choice to consider joining Strahd willingly renders the matter irrelevant. Escher begrudgingly agrees to discuss the issue further in private.

The party reconvenes in Strahd’s audience chamber. They learn that Ludmilla orchestrated the attack on Vallaki. Ireena remains livid but silent, her confusion evident.

Rahadin enters, dragging a chained prisoner with a sack over his head. The sack is removed, revealing a man whose grotesquely swollen muscles are covered in eyes. Convicted of murder in Vallaki, he was sentenced to death.

Sally attempts to argue for leniency, but Strahd, angered, declares his verdict final and orders the party to carry out the sentence. Milos steps forward, borrowing Rahadin’s sword to perform the execution.

Before his death, the prisoner accuses the party of hypocrisy, noting their own history of violence and claiming they *“have the stench of Amber about you”*. With those final words, Milos beheads him, returning the sword to Rahadin. Strahd watches, his expression unreadable.

Sasha approaches the party, handing Ziva a small pouch. Inside are the diamond earrings Strahd promised Ziva. Strahd would offer the group lodging for the night, given the weather, but seeing their impatience to leave, he refrains from insisting.

Turning to Ireena, he extends his hand. Though clearly reluctant, Ireena grits her teeth and accepts. Strahd takes her hand, bending as though to kiss it, but at the last moment, he turns it to press his lips against his own ring instead.

As the party climbs into the waiting carriage, Tian requests a private audience with Strahd, though the details of the request remain unknown. At the gates, Volenta watches the group depart, her expression smug as she idly plays with a dagger.

As the carriage moves toward the Vistani camp, Ziva examines the earrings. They are revealed to be *Earrings of Whispers*, which allow telepathic communication between wearers. Sally and Ireena each take one.

Milos senses the presence of at least 30 undead trailing the carriage, though Rahadin, who steers the vehicle, does not emit the same undead aura.

Ireena observes aloud that the party seems to trust one another less than before, a notion Ziva counters by asserting that their trust has not changed—it is simply now exposed.

Sally glances outside and notices a figure in the distance. Upon closer inspection, it proves to be a scarecrow fashioned from rags, its head replaced with a severed human one. The grotesque creation has clumsily braided hair and glass beads jammed into the eye sockets. Horrified, Sally realizes it is a twisted representation of herself. She questions Rahadin, but he dismisses her inquiries, focused solely on his task.

Milos leaps from the carriage and begins running behind it, attempting to scatter the undead following in their wake.

The carriage halts at the camp’s edge, and as the party disembarks, Rahadin drives away, disappearing into the mist. From the shadows emerges Volenta, a satisfied grin on her face. Behind her, 20 snarling undead wolves step forward.

Volenta demands the ***Tome of Strahd***. Ziva reminds her of the seven-day reprieve granted by Strahd himself, but Volenta, unmoved, insists on taking it now.

Sally asks if Volenta created the scarecrow. Without answering, Volenta hurls her dagger at the group.

The blade strikes the ground, and from its impact, a massive shadow dragon emerges, formed entirely of necrotic energy. The creature’s screech unleashes a wave of necrotic force, battering the party. Ziva, Tian, and Milos suffer significant injuries, while Ireena and Sally endure less harm, the latter’s angelic heritage shielding her further.

Tian takes to the skies, while Milos and Ireena drag Ziva toward the safety of the camp. Meanwhile, Sally, exasperated by the lack of answers, channels her druidic powers and dispels the shadow dragon with ease, leaving the party stunned and Volenta enraged.

Volenta’s laughter grows unhinged as she shifts her attention to Sally, launching a direct assault. Sally, resisting the attack, transforms into a giant eagle and flies toward the camp.

As the party retreats, they watch in horror as Volenta’s body twists unnaturally, as though manipulated by invisible strings. Her laughter echoes until she vanishes into the mist.

Madame Eva greets the party, curious about their dinner with Strahd. However, claiming her need for rest, she retreats to her private carriage. Left alone, the party gathers to share their individual bargains with Strahd.

Milos, angrily casts **Zone of Truth**, informing us that we’re gonna talk about what has happened with the wines or there will be problems and all but Ireena willingly submit to its effects:

* **Tian** was offered power and the opportunity to grow stronger. He declined by drinking red wine.  
* **Sally** was tempted with the power to kill a god, specifically Shar, but refused by pretending to drink.  
* **Ziva** was promised freedom from Barovia with Villeneuve in custody but declined by drinking white wine.  
* **Milos** was offered the power to rid the land of evil but also refused by drinking red wine.  
* **Ireena**, whose connection to Strahd is complex, reveals that she is bound to Barovia by forces beyond her control and that she needs Strahd as much as he needs her. She, too, declined by drinking red wine.

After the discussion, Milos steps out of the tent, seeking solitude at the lake’s edge.

Ireena finds Milos by the water, telling him they need to talk. Meanwhile, Ziva sends two **Sending** spells to Muriel and Urwin, warning them that Strahd is aware of the Keepers of the Feather. Muriel responds nervously, while Urwin’s reply is a single, cryptic word: *“Perfect.”*

Invisible, Ziva follows Milos, fearing he might act rashly. From a distance, she witnesses a heated exchange between Milos and Ireena but does not interfere. As the conversation ends, Milos embraces Ireena, and she discreetly passes him something from her satchel before walking away.

Milos remains by the lake for some time, lost in thought, before returning to the tent to sleep. Only after seeing him safely inside does Ziva slip into Arabelle’s tent, curling up beside the young girl. In her half-asleep state, Arabelle murmurs, mistaking Ziva for Ana, their mother.

At dawn, Arabelle wakes Ziva, brimming with curiosity about the dinner with Strahd. She brings two cups of herbal coffee-tea, and Ziva recounts the events, including Strahd's cryptic recognition of her as a “concept.” After Ziva explains what a concept is, their conversation deepens, delving into details of the dinner.

Arabelle shares a troubling vision she had of Ziva: kneeling with arms outstretched, both bloody, and screaming in anguish. Ziva, struck by the vision, asks Arabelle to teach her the ways of interpreting visions. Arabelle gleefully accepts the role of mentor.

Their discussion shifts, and Ziva mentions that Milos and Sally’s nuptials haven’t been properly celebrated. Arabelle is ecstatic, immediately declaring her intent to compose a song for the occasion.

Tian prepares breakfast, and the party eats—except for Milos, who remains withdrawn. Ziva takes a brief detour to visit the camp’s resident drag queen, purchasing makeup. She applies it afterward and finds herself struck by a revelation about her place in their dangerous journey.

Meanwhile, Arabelle, accompanied by other children, begins singing a playful tune about the “happy couple,” Milos and Sally. Milos, irritated by the teasing, casts **Darkness** on Arabelle’s clothes, causing a small panic among the children. The commotion draws Ziva’s attention, and she dispels the magical darkness just as the frightened children begin to scatter toward the forest.

Sally visits the blacksmith to check on her sword, only to find the craftsman in a foul mood. As she leaves, she encounters Ziva preparing to enter. Sally inquires about the makeup, and Ziva confesses she has resigned to the fact that she will die in this land and wishes to look her best when she does.

Inside, the blacksmith mistakes Ziva for a drag queen because of her appearance. Ziva plays along, requesting a sunburst pendant. Their haggling grows spirited until Milos interrupts, offering to pay outright. Both Ziva and the blacksmith react with shock, explaining that haggling is a cherished Vistani custom. Milos, unbothered, departs, leaving the blacksmith to gossip about the group with the older vistanas while working on the dress.

The party gathers to read from the *Tome of Strahd*, though not without preparation. Ziva, Sally, Ireena, and Tian indulge in the playful application of makeup, brightening their spirits before the task ahead. Madame Eva joins them in the tent, her tone grave.

Eva warns that Strahd has deactivated her protective magic over the camp, rendering it unsafe. She cautions that reading from the Tome will be fraught with challenges before leaving the group to their task.

Milos shares unsettling information about Sasha, Arrigal, and Gertrude, prompting mixed reactions. Arabelle defends Arrigal, expressing disbelief at the accusations. Ziva, unfamiliar with Gertrude, inquires further. Milos snaps, revealing that Gertrude is a girl from the Village and she is a prisoner in Castle Ravenloft because of him.

Ziva urges the group to adopt a policy of transparency, emphasizing the necessity of sharing any information that could affect their collective mission. The discussion grows tense when Ireena admits to Strahd's true offer: a proposal, not an ultimatum. She confesses that a part of her believes the only solution may lie in accepting her role by Strahd’s side.

The implications spark concern from Ziva, who questions whether such a choice would lift Barovia’s curse or doom Ireena to vampirism. She outlines grim scenarios of betrayal, pursuit, and desolation. She wonders how long it will be until Ireena, mirroring Tatyana’s decision, will take her own life and this cycle will begin anew. Despite this, Ireena reaffirms her willingness to sacrifice herself for the cause, challenging the group to reflect on their own commitment.

The party collectively agrees to work cohesively, reaffirming their loyalty to the mission.

Tian reveals that he did not drink the wine during his meeting with Strahd, mirroring Sally’s choice. When questioned about his intentions, Tian vehemently denies any plans of betrayal. Both Milos and Ziva scrutinize his response but find his conviction genuine. Sally shares that her refusal stemmed from a deep sense of betrayal by her mother, the group, and even Ireena at the time.

Buoyed by the emotional discussion, the group begins deciphering the Tome with Arabelle’s help. Her clever insights and logical reasoning surprise Ziva, strengthening the bond between them.

While the girls are deciphering the next passage, Milos visits Eva, seeking guidance regarding his memories and the whereabouts of Alannik van Richten. Eva speaks cryptically at first, describing Milos’s threads of fate as “ugly and twisted” but only because he perceives them that way.

Pressing for answers about van Richten, Milos learns that their paths will soon cross. He asks if Eva can manipulate fate to grant the group a kinder destiny, but she admits such power is beyond her. Instead, she warns that the “fiery one” among the group will need his help.

Frustrated by the ambiguity, Milos demands clarification, noting that all three women in the party could fit the description. For the first time, Eva speaks plainly, reiterating with a weary sigh that Ziva will need his aid. Milos’s persistent questioning momentarily disarms the enigmatic seer, a rare feat that leaves her visibly exasperated.

With the passage deciphered, the party gathers and starts to read. The next section of the **Tome of Strahd** bears the title ***Amber***. The scene unfolds with Strahd reflecting on his legacy and the dominion he has secured. He recalls learning from Patrina, the cunning dusk elf who once offered him knowledge but had begun to lose her value.

In his recollections, he revisits the sting of Tatyana’s words, calling him *“Old One”* and *“Elder”*, reminders of his mortality. Arabelle listens intently, visibly awestruck by the revelations.

The mists swirl, transporting the party to Strahd’s study.

Books float around Strahd as he searches for answers, poring over ancient texts. Patrina interrupts, bringing news of a legendary place of power atop Tsolenka Pass. She speaks of secrets and immortality, though Strahd wonders whether she truly knows his desires or merely seeks to remain in his favor.

When she offers to accompany him, Strahd refuses, determined to journey alone. The mists shift again, revealing the location deep within the mountains.

The scene changes to a frigid mountainside, where a fierce blizzard rages under the night sky. Strahd trudges through the snow, his eyes fixed on a colossal temple carved into the mountain. Towering statues flank the entrance, their forms shrouded in shadow.

Inside, the temple is vast, silent, and foreboding. Four immense amber statues dominate the main chamber, their surfaces gleaming darkly in the dim light. One statue depicts an archmage, its face a void. Smaller statues of mages with pointed hats line the walls.

A skeletal figure emerges from the darkness, its staff tapping against the marble floor with each step. Though it seems to glide rather than walk, its presence exudes ancient power. The lich, a figure Strahd once dismissed in a vision, addresses him. Strahd demands the lich’s name, but the creature admits it has long forgotten its identity.

The lich directs Strahd to his study, where they may speak further, but only if Strahd can pass a test. As the lich vanishes into the shadows, the ground trembles.

From the rumbling depths, a massive amber golem rises, accompanied by four flaming skulls. Strahd prepares for battle, knowing this confrontation is only the first step to uncovering the secrets of the Amber Temple.

The battle erupts as the party finds itself surrounded by enemies on all sides. Flaming skulls launch a barrage of fireballs, inflicting devastating injuries on half the group in the opening salvo. Arabelle, with remarkable agility, evades the blasts unscathed. Milos charges headlong into one of the flaming skulls, Sally summons a giant constrictor snake and then transforms herself into a massive scorpion, while Tian darts into the fray with precision strikes. Ziva banishes the hulking amber golem, buying precious moments of reprieve.

Before its banishment, the golem attempts to reanimate the scattered corpses littering the chamber as thralls, prompting Arabelle and Ziva to cry out warnings in unison. With the golem temporarily gone, the party concentrates on the flaming skulls, which continue to unleash relentless bursts of fire. Arabelle, with a sudden premonition, senses the skulls' impending explosion upon destruction. Acting swiftly, she teleports herself, Ireena, and Ziva into the Ethereal Plane, inadvertently breaking Ziva’s concentration and allowing the golem to reappear in the center of the chamber.

In the ethereal expanse, Ziva notices a world reversed—the rivers and lakes of the material realm are now islands surrounded by an immense ocean. Meanwhile, the remaining party members eliminate the flaming skulls. Sally, thinking quickly, polymorphs Milos into a giant sperm whale, which crashes down onto the golem, narrowly missing Tian, whose reflexes save him from certain death. The crushing impact weakens the golem, and Tian delivers the final, decisive strike. The golem shatters into countless amber shards, and Ziva carefully collects a piece as the scene dissolves into mist.

The scene reforms at a grand door, through which Strahd steps into the Lich’s study. The chamber is a boundless expanse, its walls lined with towering bookcases packed with dusty tomes. The ceiling stretches beyond sight, illuminated by a constellation of floating copper lanterns. Strahd pauses, momentarily awestruck by the sheer volume of ancient knowledge before him.

Among the party, Tian discovers and collects a few children’s books, intending them for the orphans in Vallaki. In the room’s center, the Lich stands tall, regarding Strahd with curiosity and respect for overcoming the temple’s trial. The Lich recounts the purpose of the Amber Temple: not merely a library but a bastion of containment, a sanctuary for forbidden knowledge and entities too dangerous to roam freely. Every book, every corner of this room, serves the dual purpose of enlightenment and safeguarding.

Strahd’s gaze lingers on the towering shelves, and he voices his interest in the nature of this temple. The Lich explains its legacy as the ***Forbidden Library***, the most comprehensive repository of knowledge in existence. Though no library can contain all that ever was or will be, this one comes closest. The magic within assists in locating tomes, and the library's sanctity is preserved by unyielding rules of conduct. Knowledge here is both a gift and a test—a privilege granted only to those who prove their worth.

Strahd begins to delve deeper into the purpose and usage of the Forbidden Library:

### The Nature of the Temple

The Lich, his expression shrouded in wisdom, turns to Strahd and inquires why he seeks to understand the temple’s nature. Strahd, composed and deliberate, replies that he is many things, but now he considers himself a scholar as well. The Lich accepts this answer, a flicker of approval crossing his ancient face, and reveals that Strahd now stands within the *Forbidden Library*.

For ages, the Lich has waited to share the knowledge housed here, yet none had proven worthy until now. The Forbidden Library is no ordinary repository; its purpose is twofold: to preserve knowledge and to contain things that must never escape. The Lich explains that no library can hold the entirety of all knowledge—what has been, what is, or what will be. Yet, among all such attempts, the Forbidden Library comes closest. Here lies most of what humanity has written, what mages have scribed, what scholars have uncovered, and even what gods have spoken. The Library itself is enchanted, its magic guiding seekers to the tomes they desire.

### Forbidden Knowledge

Strahd’s curiosity sharpens. Is there a section of the Library forbidden even to him?

The Lich offers a cryptic smile. "Everything here is forbidden," he says, gesturing broadly to the infinite shelves. But knowledge, he insists, should never be truly barred from anyone. The danger lies not in the knowledge itself, but in wielding it irresponsibly. Wisdom and ethics must temper all learning.

### What Must Never Escape

Strahd’s voice lowers, and he asks the Lich what things within the Library must never be unleashed.

The Lich’s tone grows somber. Knowledge, he says, holds great peril, and so this place was not built alone. Alongside his companions, he created the Library as a sanctuary for dangerous powers. Many of these powers are entities considered gods by mortals. Turning to Strahd, the Lich asks if he believes in gods.

Strahd hesitates before answering, admitting that the terminology feels fickle to him. Gods, he muses, are often labels assigned to forces beyond comprehension.

The Lich nods in agreement. *"Precisely. What we call gods are merely terms for what we do not understand. When knowledge expands, new names can be given. Even monstrosities housed here, contained in amber prisons, could be worshipped as gods by those who fail to grasp their true nature. But these entities must never roam free again."*

The Lich’s voice softens, tinged with sorrow, as he urges Strahd to tread carefully. Many sacrifices—lives of those he loved—were made to seal the Dark Powers contained here. Strahd, uncharacteristically solemn, agrees. Shifting the conversation, he asks about other deities, particularly the Rozanas.

The Lich speaks of myths and beliefs. Many so-called gods arise from collective stories, he explains, their power given form by the minds of those who believe. He shares a theory about planar synchronicity: in planes where collective consciousness prevails, shared belief can create reality. If enough people believe something exists, their belief becomes the cause of its existence.

Realizing his digression, the Lich refocuses. The Rozanas, he affirms, are no myth. These three entities are very real and serve as the stewards of the land. They control its cycles: the growth of plants, the movement of water and air, the life of beasts, and their inevitable death. In a sense, ***the Rozanas are the land*** ***itself.***

### The Lich’s Most Read Book

Strahd’s gaze drifts to the countless tomes. He asks the Lich which book among them he finds most compelling.

The Lich’s lips curl in a rare smile. *“The book containing the numbers of Pi”*, he answers simply.

### The Test of Worthiness

Strahd, his curiosity unabated, challenges the Lich: If knowledge is not meant to be forbidden, why the test to access it?

The Lich’s tone turns stern. While knowledge should not be barred, it should not be granted without effort. Without challenge, it would be undervalued. The Forbidden Library was never intended as a public resource; it was created to contain the Dark Powers. Only those who prove themselves worthy may peruse its depths.

Strahd, the test now behind him, is welcome to return whenever he wishes, so long as he abides by the Library’s rules.

As the conversation deepens, the Lich speaks the phrase **"Dark Powers"**.  A shiver passes through the Library as a dissonant chorus rises from its very structure. The whispers echo, overlapping and disjointed:

***TIME... ETERNAL... EMBRACE... DAWN... YOUTH... REBIRTH...***

Strahd listens intently, the haunting whispers a siren call to his ever-growing curiosity.

The scene shifts, dissolving into a montage of visions. Strahd is shown returning to the *Forbidden Library* time and again, drawn by the promise of knowledge contained within its infinite shelves. He pores over ancient tomes of arcane lore, his conversations with the Lich growing increasingly profound and philosophical.

One day, Strahd begins studying the magical fortifications of structures, a topic of particular interest. As his knowledge expands, he expresses a desire to bring his trusted architect, Khazan, to the Library, so that he too might benefit from its wealth of wisdom. The Lich agrees, granting permission on the condition that Khazan abides by the Library's sacred rules. Strahd, with unwavering confidence, vouches for him.

Yet, through all his visits, Strahd continues to hear the whispers—those echoing voices that haunt the Library’s halls. Their cryptic words linger in the air, a constant reminder of the darker truths contained within this place.

The scene reforms, revealing Strahd once again seated within the Library. Before him lies an ancient tome inscribed with vertical script. Its topics are unsettling: ***Dark Effigies, Dark Vestiges, Dark Powers****.* His curiosity piqued, Strahd turns to the Lich, posing a pointed question: What are these Dark Powers? Were they truly sealed here by the Lich and his companions?

The Lich hesitates, his response measured and cautious. Some of these Powers, he admits, were imprisoned here by their hands. Others were shattered and splintered, but only at great cost. This is treacherous ground, he warns, and one he is loath to tread.

Strahd presses on, insisting that his interest is purely academic. To understand, he argues, one must see and study firsthand.

The Lich’s gaze darkens. The Powers are dangerous, he warns, his voice heavy with foreboding. *"I fear what your curiosity might awaken."* Reluctantly, he offers to guide Strahd to the chambers where the Powers are contained, but his warning is clear: a single misstep will force his hand, and he will not hesitate to end Strahd’s life if necessary.

Strahd, resolute, accepts the terms.

The scene shifts once more. Strahd walks beside the Lich through the labyrinthine halls of the Amber Temple. Their path winds ever deeper until they reach a series of chambers. Each room houses enormous amber sarcophagi, their surfaces etched with arcane symbols. Within each prison, a wisp of malevolent darkness churns, an unsettling presence that radiates power.

Finally, the pair arrives at a chamber containing three sarcophagi. The air here feels heavier, charged with an almost tangible menace. As Strahd steps into the room, his composure falters for a moment. He twitches, as though bombarded by phantom sounds—discordant, deafening noises that exist only in his mind.

Strahd studies the room, then straightens and declares himself satisfied. His tone is calm, yet there is an edge of tension beneath his words. Without another glance at the sarcophagi, he requests to return to the Library.

The Lich, silent and watchful, leads him away.

The scene reforms, cloaked in shadow and silence. Strahd moves through the Amber Temple under the cover of darkness, his footsteps deliberate and soundless. He retraces his path to the chamber of the three sarcophagi, drawn by a magnetic pull he cannot ignore.

As he enters the room, an overwhelming cacophony erupts in his mind—three distinct voices, each vying for dominance, their cries piercing and insistent.

#### **The Sarcophagus of Zhuduun, the Corpse Star**

Strahd approaches the first sarcophagus, its amber surface glowing faintly with an otherworldly light. As he gazes upon it, an invisible force pulls him closer, irresistible and unnerving. He extends a hand, his fingers brushing the cold, smooth surface.

Instantly, a voice floods his mind, deep and resonant, filled with ancient power:  
*"Awaken the ancient slumber with the power of a star. Death legions are yours to command."*

The name crystallizes in his thoughts—*Zhuduun, the Corpse Star.*

For a moment, Strahd lingers, the weight of the offer pressing upon him. Then, with a sharp intake of breath, he pulls his hand away, breaking the connection. The voice vanishes as suddenly as it began, leaving only silence. He turns from the sarcophagus, resolute, and moves toward the second.

#### **The Sarcophagus of Tenebrous, the Knowledgeable**

The second sarcophagus exudes an air of profound mystery. When Strahd’s hand makes contact, a different voice fills his mind, smooth and contemplative, its tone rich with promise:  
*"Seek eternity, seeker of arcane lore. Wisdom and power above your mortal ken."*

This is *Tenebrous, the Knowledgeable,* a name that resonates with Strahd’s unrelenting thirst for understanding. He pauses, his hand lingering on the surface as the words echo in his thoughts. The temptation is strong, the allure undeniable.

But doubt and determination rise within him. *Not like this,* he thinks, the phrase becoming a mantra. Slowly, he withdraws his hand, the voice fading into silence. Strahd turns toward the third sarcophagus, his expression grim.

#### **The Sarcophagus of Vampyr**

The final sarcophagus seems to hum with an energy unlike the others—seductive, compelling, alive. As Strahd’s fingers meet its surface, the voice that greets him is velvety, feminine, and dangerously alluring:  
*"Time shall bow to you, my Prince of Darkness. Embrace the shadows. Youth everlasting. Let the night be your ally forever, where age is a forgotten whisper."*

The name *Vampyr* slides into his mind like a shadow creeping into a room. The voice’s words strike a nerve, and Strahd’s thoughts drift to Tatyana, to the moments she called him “old one” and “elder”. Pain wells up, and he begins to weep, tears streaking silently down his face.

For a heartbeat, the promise tempts him: eternal youth, the erasure of the years, the chance to reclaim his pride. But the cost looms large in his mind, the weight of the price Vampyr demands.

With a shuddering breath and an effort that shakes his entire being, Strahd pushes himself away from the sarcophagus. His voice trembles, though he speaks only to himself: *Not like this. I will not pay this price.*

The whispers cease. The room falls silent. Strahd turns and walks away, his steps firm but heavy, leaving the sarcophagi and their dark promises behind.

As the party emerges from the vision, Strahd’s astral form materializes in the mist, seated atop his throne. His demeanor is cold, his displeasure palpable. He observes the party’s audacity in delving deeper into His privacy by reading His personal Tome. Strahd addresses their apparent comfort in the safety of the Vistani camp, noting the dishonor in exploiting a place He would not desecrate due to an old debt.

In a calculated gesture, Strahd proposes a game to make the situation more interesting. He challenges the party to leave the camp and continue reading the Tome elsewhere, promising to ensure their efforts will not be easy. The party, left with little choice, silently accepts His challenge.

Turning His attention to Ireena, Strahd urges her to continue learning about the world and her place within it. Aware of her concerns for her brother and the villagers, He vows that His night creatures will no longer prey upon Barovia but instead protect it, sealing the promise with His word.

Strahd then formally introduces Himself to Arabelle, posing questions about her memories, her seer abilities, and any visions of displaced time. Arabelle deflects with vague responses, playing coy, her innocence masking any deeper truths. Strahd’s expression darkens with curiosity, wondering aloud at Eva’s game before bidding the party farewell. The mist dissipates as His image fades.

Once Strahd departs, Arabelle remarks on the similarities between Him and Eva, noting the dangers Eva faces for pushing the boundaries of what is allowed. She advises the party to temper their treatment of Eva, warning them not to antagonize her further.

The party deliberates on their next move, reaffirming the plan to help Stella by brewing the potion. Collecting ingredients along Lake Zarovich’s shores also provides an opportunity to search for the Mad Mage, known to frequent the area. Though uncertain about the potion’s exact preparation, they decide to experiment on Milos, who volunteers as a test subject.

During the discussion, Ziva proposes testing the mysterious **Bloodstone**. She theorizes its connection to the land and suggests using it as a focus to scry on van Richten. The party opposes the idea, wary of the artifact’s unknown power. Ziva, however, argues that ignoring its potential renders it useless. Resolute, she casts **Scry** through the **Bloodstone**, channeling divine magic.

For a fleeting moment, the spell works. Her vision, tinged red, reveals an older man with a limp, quill in hand, scribbling furiously. The man notices the scry sensor and hurls a blue gemstone toward it, shattering the spell. Instead of returning to her body, Ziva’s consciousness is dragged through a crimson tunnel into a black abyss. Her physical body convulses, her eyes blackened as she grips the stone tighter. The **Bloodstone** shifts, its hue turning amber.

Milos tries to wrest the stone from her grasp, but Ziva’s grip is unyielding.

Ziva begins to hear whispers, faint at first, then growing louder and louder, as she feels herself being pulled deeper into the nothingness. The voices echo around her, tempting and cajoling, offering her everything she’s ever desired or could ever want. They tell her they are here, that they want her, and that they cannot die. They ask what they can do for her.

As Milos attempts to pry the Bloodstone from her hand, the voices acknowledge his interference. They tell him that his turn will come, but first, Ziva must decide. Which one of them will she choose? They are all, they are nothing, they are the Land.

The voices hint at more entities, more beings that crave her, but the Dark Powers can deal with them. Her soul is fragile, stretched thin, and cracked. Which one of them will she choose?

Ziva rejects them, declaring that their words are poison. She has enough voices in her head already and doesn’t need any more. She screams for them to be quiet, and for a moment, the darkness around her stills, before it shifts, coalescing into an exact replica of Ziva.

The voices warn her that if she does not willingly choose, they will force her hand. But Ziva, unshaken, replies that this is not the first time she’s faced a situation like this. She knows exactly what she must do. Without hesitation, she hurls a fireball at her dark counterpart, the blast searing her evil twin.

Dark Ziva grins, taunting her. She tells Ziva that while she fights bravely, deep down, she is just a scared, selfish girl who will abandon everyone when they’re no longer useful. She has already turned her back on her family, leaving them behind for Waterdeep, only to fail there too. She has lost the man she loved and her only true friend. Ziva is a failure, incapable of caring for anyone, and will never amount to anything.

Ziva scoffs, asking if this is the best her counterpart can do. The words may have hurt her once, but no longer. She has worked through her past and knows who she is now, and what she’s worth. The insults don’t sting.

Dark Ziva’s taunt shifts to Arabelle, claiming that the innocent girl will die at Ziva’s feet because she is incapable of protecting anyone. But Ziva remains focused. Despite the trash talk, she stays in control, pushing her opponent back, forcing her to cast spell after spell to evade the flames of their battle.

With a final surge of power, Ziva strikes down her doppelgänger, and the voices, once again, fade to a whisper. They tell her they will be waiting, that her choice is not over, and when she returns, they’ll be there to greet her.

Ziva awakens, throwing the **Bloodstone** away in terror. She recounts her ordeal, describing the malevolent entities within the stone and their desperation for a host. The party speculates that the **Bloodstone** is either a fragment of the **Amber Temple** or a key to containing the **Dark Powers**. They wonder if Strahd collected the stones to prevent others from unleashing the **Powers**.

Ziva warns of the **Powers’** insidious nature, casting a knowing glance at Milos, cautioning against succumbing to their temptation. She turns to Arabelle, offering her the choice to leave the group if their journey ever becomes too dangerous or uncomfortable. Her doppelgänger’s words seem to linger, leaving Ziva more introspective.

Arabelle dismisses the concern, asserting her independence and free will. The party disperses for the evening.

Later, Ziva approaches Milos, asking him to train her to improve her pain tolerance, enhancing her focus during combat. Milos begins with breathing exercises, suggesting they practice while submerged in the lake. He omits the advantage of his vampiric nature, allowing him to hold his breath indefinitely.

Ziva, determined not to be outdone, pushes herself to her limits. Realizing his vampirism, she stubbornly stays underwater until near unconsciousness. As she begins to black out, she experiences two rapid visions:

1. A scar-free Milos cradling a frail, lifeless woman, overcome with grief.  
2. Milos, sword in hand, standing over a defeated and bloodied Strahd.

Milos pulls Ziva to safety as she regains consciousness. She describes the visions, but Milos denies recognizing them, suggesting they belong to a different time.

Their conversation shifts to recent events. Ziva empathizes with Milos’s struggles, sharing her journey toward self-improvement and redemption. Milos appreciates the sentiment but reminds her that his crimes weigh heavier.

Ziva brings up the Lathander-marked doors in Ravenloft, speculating that Milos’s choice to lead a better life severed his oath to Strahd. She channels divine energy, creating Lathander’s symbol in rose-gold flames within Milos’s scorched holy circle.

Tian visits Madame Eva’s caravan, seeking clarity on his decision. Eva offers cryptic advice, urging him to forge his own path, even if it diverges from her tapestry. Before he leaves, she warns him that Ziva has brought great evil into the camp tonight and that she will need his help moving forward.

Sally sits by the water’s edge, running her fingers through the still surface, seeking a connection with the deadened nature around her.

Sally stands at the forest’s edge, reaching out with her senses, hoping to connect with the nature around her. She calls on the **"Ladies Three"**, the spirits of nature that used to govern Barovia. The response isn’t what she expects. Instead of connecting with one of the Ladies, she hears the voice of Madame Eva who slowly approaches her.

Eva’s voice cuts through the stillness as she asks Sally directly if she is a coward. She explains that while gods are many things, they serve one crucial purpose: they are a lifeline for fools. Rather than seeking divine intervention like Ziva and Milos, Sally has the power to help herself, for her magic is different from the others. Eva guides Sally’s attention to a nearby tree, urging her to touch it and listen. Sally follows, but when she places her hand on the bark, the tree offers no response.

Eva challenges Sally, questioning if just touching the tree has done anything for her. The tree, she explains, is dying from the inside, a suffering unknown to the outside world. Sally needs to truly listen to nature, not just connect with her own magic but to reach deeper, to feel beyond the surface.

Sally takes a deep breath and closes her eyes, remembering a time when she had done this kind of work before, when *“that guy”* had trained her. She recalls how, for too long, she’s been deafened by her own desires and motivations. Now, she extends her senses outward again, reaching deep within herself. Slowly, she begins to feel the pulse of the tree—a slow, painful rhythm like the heartbeat of an old man nearing the end. She listens as the tree conveys that it simply wishes to die, showing her the souls of parasites feeding on its body, the fungi eating away at it from the inside. The tree’s suffering is immense.

Sally understands the tree’s wish. Without hesitation, she sets it aflame. The tree feels a strange relief as the fire begins to consume it. Eva slaps Sally lightly on the head in disapproval. Sally explains her choice, but Eva simply tells her to listen better next time.

Sally, undeterred, uses her magic to cast **Plant Growth**, and from the ashes of the burned tree, a tiny seedling pushes through the charred earth. Eva directs her to a place near the Old Bonegrinder Mill, advising her to listen closely to the nature there. With that, Madame Eva leaves, leaving Sally to climb a tree and settle in for the night, surrounded by the quiet of the forest.

Meanwhile, Ziva visits a leatherworker, seeking to have straps crafted for the extra-dimensional box they received from Strahd, hoping to turn it into a wearable backpack. While the work is being done, she casts several **Sending** spells. Van Richten’s mindshield blocks her message. Her attempt to reach Arrigal fails, hinting that he may be far from Barovia. However, Luvash responds, revealing that they are currently outside Krezk but are considering returning to Vallaki unless they receive further instructions.

The next day, in the Vistani camp at Tser’s Pool, Tian prepares breakfast for the group while Ireena, Arabelle, and Ziva enjoy a relaxing bath in the pool. Ziva takes the opportunity to find Ireena and asks for her help with a new choker she’s crafting. As they work, Ziva casually inquires if Ireena still has feelings for Milos. Ireena, caught off guard, agrees to indulge Ziva, but only if Ziva answers some of her own questions in return. Ziva agrees, and Ireena asks about Ziva’s first love.

Ziva smiles and recounts her childhood crush, Peter, from her village of Red Larch. Peter had been her first love, and had circumstances been different, Ziva would have been living a simple, peaceful life on a farm, married with children. But that was before Marial, Ziva’s best friend, betrayed her by sleeping with Peter behind her back. In a fit of rage, sixteen-year-old Ziva nearly killed them both, though it wasn’t her intention.

Ziva confesses that she had stolen some lotion from the local temple, planning for Marial to find it while seeing Peter. The lotion, unbeknownst to her, was cursed and it  had unforeseen consequences, and a healer from Goldenfields had to be brought in to treat them before it was too late. Though no one could prove Ziva’s involvement, the village knew. Her parents sent her away to Waterdeep, hoping to cool the storm. Ziva ended up apprenticing to a seamstress, though she was terrible at sewing and often used her own fingers as pincushions.

Ireena laughs softly, acknowledging that no matter how dark things get, there’s always room for teenage angst and drama—Barovia is no different. She then shares her thoughts on Milos. Their past relationship had been built on mutual support, but now, Ireena feels too overwhelmed by everything else to focus on romantic matters. No, she doesn’t have feelings for Milos anymore, but there is still a connection between them.

Ziva asks if Ireena is sure, because she’s considering making a move on Milos herself. When Ireena questions Ziva’s motives, Ziva admits that while Milos is complicated and has many red flags, there’s something about him that intrigues her. He’s not a bad person, but their situation is complicated already, and she doesn’t want to complicate it further.

Ireena wishes her luck, and Ziva, in turn, offers some unconventional advice, in the form of a metaphor about pigs and chickens. She tells Ireena to explore her desires without guilt, to try what might seem frowned upon—after all, they might not have much time left in this bleak world. Ireena deserves happiness, however fleeting it may be. Ziva also tells her that if she ever needs help deciphering any metaphors, Sally is the person to ask.

Finally, Ziva offers Ireena the backpack she made for her and asks her to keep the **Bloodstone** in it, knowing that Milos might try to take it in hopes of exploiting its connection to the **Dark Powers**. Ziva believes that accepting one of the **Dark Powers** could change someone irreparably, possibly even turning them into another Strahd. Ireena agrees, but reminds Ziva that in Barovia, the only thing left is the freedom to make choices. If Milos asks for the **Bloodstone**, Ireena will give it to him, even if she knows it’s the wrong decision.

With that settled, the two continue working on the sunburst choker, and soon it’s finished.

Afterwards, Ziva seeks out Eva in her caravan, starting the conversation by asking about the two cats Eva keeps—Alain and Zelda. She’s curious why they bear names that aren’t typical in Barovia, names that happen to belong to Ziva’s adoptive parents. Eva has had the cats for some time, and she brushes off Ziva’s questions, explaining the names are based on the cats’ temperaments, offering no deeper insight.

Frustrated, Ziva shifts the conversation to a darker topic—the night Van Richten attacked the Vistani camp. She gently takes Eva’s hands in hers, hoping to sense if she’s hiding something. Ziva recalls Van Richten commanding undead creatures to attack, and the black, magical smoke surrounding his head, a curse she recognizes as a Vistana mark. She asks Eva if she had anything to do with the attack.

Eva becomes defensive and angry. She scolds Ziva for feeling entitled to answers, accusing her of bullying others to get what she wants. Ziva presses on, determined to understand the truth, but Eva tells her that she’s not really a detective and shouldn’t waste her life looking for answers in the past. She should instead live the life she has.

Ziva snaps back, explaining that her life was taken from her, and now she needs to know why. She demands to know why the attack happened, why she was cast out into the world. Eva, unsympathetic, tells Ziva that she’s not entitled to anything, and that Ziva can be angry all she wants, but Eva won’t care.

Finally, Eva concedes, confirming that Van Richten was cursed—but only after the attack on the camp. With that, the conversation ends, and Ziva, frustrated and defeated, storms out of the caravan.

As the party prepares to leave the camp, Ziva quietly slips a pouch into Arabelle’s belongings, an act noticed by both Tian and Sally. The group gathers their things, says their goodbyes, and departs the camp.

To pass the time on the journey, Ireena starts a Barovian song game, and Tian keeps watch from above, spotting an old, decrepit watchtower they missed on their previous journey. Milos and Tian head toward the tower to investigate. Milos doesn’t recall seeing the tower before, but they find two freshly dug graves and a carcass of an animal outside. Inside, Milos detects an undead presence.

The rest of the party arrives at the tower, where Ziva calls out, but there’s no answer. Milos climbs to the first floor, finding a trapdoor and a silver pendant with an engraved dragon. As he reaches for the pendant, a voice warns him: *“Old things are stirring, and the Lord of Ravenloft roams the Valley.”*

A revenant appears, pointing a sword at Milos, and six banshees materialize from the walls, ready for battle.

The clash begins as the banshees and revenant descend upon the party. The piercing wails of three banshees drop half the group into unconsciousness, their cries shaking the foundation of resolve. Those still standing struggle to fend off the banshees while trying to revive their fallen allies.

Milos falls under the revenant’s assault, his unconscious form wracked by visions of falling through a hellish realm. Little devils claw at him, tearing at the tattoos of the Morninglord's symbol etched into his skin. Around him, chaos deepens as the revenant summons a magical blizzard, obscuring vision and adding an unforgiving chill to the battle.

Sally feels an inexplicable force emanating from the ancient wood beneath her feet, a magical pull that seems to guide her toward the revenant. Even as she resists, the party struggles.

Milos, still locked in his nightmare, begins to experience memories from lifetimes past. *A dim room, a rickety bed, and a sobbing woman with red hair that obscures her face. The cries echo in his mind, distant yet painfully vivid.*

As the banshees’ screams continue, Ziva, Milos, and Ireena succumb, leaving only Sally and Tian standing. Arabelle, unwillingly drawn into the Ethereal Plane, vanishes from sight. Desperately wounded, Tian retreats, leaving Sally to face their foes alone.

Just as the situation seems hopeless, Arabelle reappears, pulling everyone into the Ethereal Plane. In the relative safety of this otherworldly space, Sally restores Milos and Ziva. Milos regains consciousness and heals Ireena, while Ziva tends to the others’ wounds.

Outside, the revenant commands the banshees to return to their rest as the blizzard begins to fade. Tian, scouting the now-empty tower, calls out to the party but receives no reply. The revenant rises once more, addressing Tian directly. He orders him to inform Strahd that the Knights still stand and will continue their defiance.

Tian attempts to explain that he is no servant of Strahd. In response, the revenant demands proof. Tian recounts the events from the ***Tome of Strahd***, describing the battle in which Argynvost fell. The revenant, confused, believes the dragon to still be alive, his sense of time fractured by years of undeath.

As the rest of the party emerges from the Ethereal Plane, tension escalates. Ziva and the revenant exchange sharp words until Ireena steps forward to mediate. She shares her pain and struggles, connecting with the revenant on the shared torment that binds all Barovians. The revenant listens, though his distrust lingers.

The blizzard dissipates entirely as Ireena explains the party's shared goal to fight the horrors of Barovia, their bonds transcending bloodlines and past allegiances.

The revenant reveals the tragic history of the banshees. Once a family who lived peacefully in the tower, they fell victim to Strahd’s monstrous forces. The graves outside belong to a man and woman who attempted escape, only to be hunted down. It was the revenant himself who gave them a proper burial.

Tian continues recounting the events from the ***Tome of Strahd***, helping the revenant piece together fragmented memories. The revenant starts to speak of the Order of the Silver Dragon, now a company of revenants bound by oaths of vengeance. The order’s commander, Vladimir Hornguard, has devolved into a hateful and desolate spirit. Where once he led with honor, now he is consumed by madness.

The revenant tells of their tragic mission. The knights initially fought to end Strahd's tyranny but became bound to the land. When Sergei was murdered and Tatyana's soul became trapped, Vladimir ordered the knights to assault Ravenloft. On the way, they met Madame Eva who told them that Strahd was dead, trapped and bound to this land. Hearing this, Hornguard, feeling content that Strahd will suffer for eternity, ordered his knights to halt the assault. His madness also rationalized that all the people trapped in this land alongside Strahd, was a good price for trapping Strahd in Barovia.

The revenant urges the party to seek Godfrey Gwilym, one of the few knights who retains a sense of reason. He mentions that some of the Knights wanted to fight in the rebellion a year ago (led by Milos), but Vladimir’s commanded them to stand down and refuse aid. Ziva suggests that if Vladimir could be swayed, the knights might rise again to join their cause.

As the party leaves the tower, Sally reaffirms their mission. Her angelic wings flare briefly, a symbol of hope and determination. The revenant watches as they depart, silent but contemplative.

The old Bonegrinder Mill looms before the party, its defenses and furnishings clearly enhanced since their last visit. The party notices the four stone obelisks surrounding the mill, one of which bears the head of a raven.

Approaching the mill, distant screams pierce the air, spurring the party inside. They find Jenny locked in a fierce battle—against a rodent. Milos dispatches the tiny beast with ease, and attention turns to conversation with the witch.

Jenny inspects the silver necklace Milos pocketed from the decrepit watchtower, dismissing it as a simple trinket. Ziva presses Jenny about her dealings in Barovia, steering the discussion toward the celestial known to reside in the land. Jenny, in her rambling, hints that the celestial is trapped within a church but backtracks hastily when further questioned.

Milos purchases a Bag of Holding for Arabelle, receiving a peculiar pair of “nikkers” as a bonus gift. The gesture catches Arabelle off guard, and she awkwardly hugs Milos in gratitude. Meanwhile, Ziva steps outside to scout for threats. Though she notices her senses heightening near the mill, she detects nothing unusual beyond its walls.

Taking a moment of respite, Ziva uses her magic to **Stone Shape**, crafting dice, a unicorn figurine for Arabelle, and two busts—one of Jenny depicted as youthful and beautiful, the other of Madame Eva with exaggerated features. She returns just as Jenny begins delegating tasks in exchange for a night’s shelter: Tian is to cook dinner, Ziva to clean, Milos to give a massage, and Sally to enrich the surrounding land.

The party sets to their tasks. Ziva, however, summons her Unseen Servant, Darnell, to do the cleaning, while she lounges to observe Milos’s massage session. Milos finds Jenny’s form unnervingly youthful beneath the illusion of her older appearance.

Sally ventures outside, seeking to connect with the land using guidance from Eva. As she attempts to cast **Plant Growth**, she encounters a barrier of death suffocating the soil. Plants wither and decay moments after sprouting, and Sally halts the ritual, burying her hands into the earth to concentrate.

A trance overtakes her, and a figure manifests from shadows—an ethereal woman formed of black smoke, adorned with raven feathers and twigs. Her glowing white eyes pierce the darkness of her face. The figure extends a hand, twigs forming raven-like shapes, and whispers, *"I made them. It was my gift to the world. They are sacred to me. Strahd knew they were sacred."*

The shadows collapse as the figure's form falters, leaving behind a raven. The bird shows Sally visions woven from twigs: Strahd leading Morgantha’s coven to the mill, breaking the necks of ravens as they struggle in his grip. The horrific scene repeats, emphasizing his cruelty. The vision shifts to the monoliths crumbling and the land decaying. The raven pleads for Sally’s aid, foretelling that the time to act will come and revealing four figures who might hold answers:

* A decrepit, sneering old woman (Lysaga)  
* A man in armor with a skeletal visage, hair blowing in ghostly wind (Godfrey Gwilym)  
* A hovering figure with a staff (the Lich of the Amber Temple)  
* A humanoid raven (Tian)

As the vision ends, Sally collapses into a deep slumber, the strain overwhelming her.

Meanwhile, Ziva trades her crafted busts for ruby dust, but Jenny lets slip that Eva may be her sister before clamming up. As the party gathers for dinner, Milos notices Sally’s absence and finds her outside, unconscious. He carries her to a bed in the makeshift room prepared for the group. Venturing further into the mill, he discovers Jenny’s room adorned with an altar of images—depictions of himself in various poses.

At dinner, Jenny informs the party that Blinsky has contacted her, requesting their help retrieving Piddlewick. Ziva uses **Sending** to inform Blinsky that the party is alive, but her message alarms him, as he mistakes the telepathic communication for a vampire’s intrusion.

Milos presents a dress he has crafted for Sally, a symbol of their wedding, stunning the party with its beauty. Inspired, Milos and Ireena discuss plans to start a clothing business, with Jenny as their distributor. Jenny advises the party to work together and trust one another, warning that a single failure could doom them all.

She turns the discussion to healing Stella’s mind, explaining that ritual ingredients tied to the target are more potent. She urges the party to seek the Astell flower—an anagram of Stella—as a potential component.

After dinner, Milos and Tian train outside while Ziva and Arabelle watch. Once the session concludes, Ziva asks Arabelle for guidance in controlling her visions. Arabelle enthusiastically begins teaching Ziva about the cards and their use in interpreting the tapestry of fate.

Ziva recalls a vision of experiencing life through Laszlo’s eyes, omitting his name to avoid alarming Milos. Arabelle encourages her to attempt a reading. Ziva, hesitant at first, gives Milos a reading, drawing five cards:

* **The Executioner**: Approaching death  
* **The Diviner**: Intuition and prophecy  
* **The Necromancer**: Facing inner darkness  
* **The Innocent**: The importance of compassion  
* **The Torturer**: Suffering and complicity

Though inexperienced, Ziva delivers an insightful reading influenced by her perception of Milos. Arabelle praises her progress, declaring the lesson a success.

As Arabelle leaves, Ziva contemplates the cards and their connection to Milos. Her focus lingers on *The Torturer*, seeing it as the thread that binds them all.

Milos shares his visions of a past life with Ziva and Arabelle: fragmented memories of a woman weeping in a shabby bed and the torment of tattoos being torn apart by imps and devils as he plummeted through the hells. Ziva reflects on her own visions of him, cradling a dead woman’s body in despair. She speculates that these glimpses into his past, not tied to Barovia, must belong to the same lifetime, as escape from Barovia is impossible.

Tian joins them outside, and Ziva offers him a reading. As Arabelle observes, she critiques Ziva for interpreting the cards too literally, encouraging her to delve deeper into their meaning. Meanwhile, Milos busies himself embellishing Arabelle’s Bag of Holding, sewing a smiley face onto it and promising to add depictions of the sun and stars—despite never having seen stars.

Seeking solitude, Ziva moves to the back of the mill near the obelisks and attempts to send a message via the **Sending** spell to Hector Villeneuve. The spell fails to connect. Grasping the grim implications—that Hector is either dead or beyond Barovia’s borders—she sits quietly, overwhelmed, and begins to cry.

Inside, Milos seeks out Jenny to ask about the golden skin and tattoos from his visions, but she has no knowledge of what he describes.

Upstairs, Ireena has deciphered part of the ***Tome of Strahd***. Her progress is limited, as the next section of the text requires a cipher key the party does not possess. What she has managed to translate begins with a chapter titled *The March of Dawn.* As she reads aloud, Strahd’s voice resonates through the room: *“In life, the Morninglord’s light never reached me. In death, His presence was an eternal plague.”*

They decide to pause and involve the entire party before proceeding further. Milos attempts to wake Sally, still in a deep slumber after her communion with nature. When gentler methods fail, he slaps her, startling her awake. In her panic, Sally casts *Thunderwave.* The resulting explosion shatters the windows, hurls Ireena against a wall, and sends Milos flying out of the room—landing on Ziva, still crying below.

The rest of the party rushes upstairs to investigate the commotion, with Jenny storming in, demanding compensation for the damage. Ireena, bruised but composed, chastises Sally for her repeated overreactions and implores her to stop responding with such volatile magic.

Regaining her composure, Sally recounts her vision during the communion with the Rozanas, revealing that the Rozanas created the wereravens.

After some debate over who will stay behind to guard against potential interference from Strahd, the party ultimately decides to enter the ***Tome of Strahd*** together.

The party again hears Strahd’s voice narrating: *“In life, the Morninglord’s light never reached me. In death, His presence was an eternal plague.”*

The mists swirl and the narration gives way to a vivid scene. The party stands on the castle battlements in the rain, alongside Strahd and Rahadin, they are generals in his service. Far below, banners march through the darkness, hundreds of soldiers led by a radiant beacon of light.

Markovia leads the assault in the name of Lathander, her forces pressing toward the castle. The bridge collapses, granting them access to the fortress. Rahadin and Strahd exchange words: Strahd remarks on Andral’s death nearly two decades ago, expressing surprise at how quickly time has passed. He recalls that Andral died defending a city, and now Markovia has risen to challenge him with a righteous fury.

As the enemy surges forward, Strahd relishes the anticipation of battle, a rare spark of life stirring within him. He offers the party a choice: to face the invaders on the battlefield or to confront the “uninvited guests” who have infiltrated the castle. The party opts for the latter, unwilling to fight villagers or a servant of Lathander directly.

Strahd leaps from the battlements, summoning Bucephalus, his winged horse of smoke and flame, and plunges into the fray below. Rahadin leads the party deeper into the castle’s hidden corridors, providing instructions for their mission. Strahd, aware of an adventuring party that has allied with Markovia, has trapped them inside the castle for his amusement. The party is tasked with dispatching them.

The party encounters the adventurers immediately. A towering paladin bearing Lathander’s symbol stands alongside a wizard crackling with arcane energy, the bodies of five slain vampires strewn at their feet. The battle begins, and a third foe—a lean figure in black leathers—joins the fray, attacking Sally.

The adventurers prove formidable, dealing significant damage. The party manages to defeat the wizard, but the paladin channels divine power to resurrect her and restore her strength.

As the struggle continues, flashes of light outside reveal Aurica Markovia striking Strahd with divine might, disintegrating Bucephalus. Strahd, enraged, taunts the invaders: *“You come here to my house and think to challenge your god? I will teach you the consequences of such actions.”*

Dark magic swirls around him as he transforms the falling rain into blood. The battlefield erupts into chaos and despair, the invaders trembling before his display of power.

The party swiftly eliminates the adventuring party within the castle. Outside, the battle continues to rage. The falling blood-rain sows panic among the invaders, breaking their ranks and spreading chaos. Strahd's voice thundered across the battlefield, mocking their audacity: *“Was it foolishness or naïveté that led you to enter my lair uninvited? No matter. You will learn the consequences of coming to my home and seeking to harm me.”*

Amid the chaos, Aurica Markovia, the new Dawnmaster, steps forward with unwavering faith. She charges Strahd, and as their weapons clash, their exchange reveals deep personal history. Markovia declares her intention to end Strahd’s reign, insisting that the Morninglord will pierce his eternal darkness and restore hope to Barovia. Strahd, with cold amusement, dismisses her words. He declares that the people will live under his rule, in darkness, for hope is nothing but a fleeting illusion.

Markovia challenges Strahd, recalling a time when they had shared a vision for a thriving Barovia. She speaks of past unity, of meals shared and plans made to better the land. Strahd reminisces, acknowledging that while they never agreed fully, their shared hope for the kingdom had once united them. Yet, he warns that such hope is a weakness. It had been Andral’s undoing, and it will be Markovia’s as well.

Markovia, undeterred, reaffirms her connection to the Morninglord. She credits his presence for her strength to heal the wounded and raise the fallen. Strahd, scoffing at her faith, claims to have been abandoned by the gods, left to wallow in darkness. With a cruel smile, he announces that Lathander’s voice will never again reach her.

As Strahd’s form erupts into a sphere of agonizing darkness, the battlefield descends into horror. The lifeforce of those caught within the darkness is siphoned away. Ziva attempts to channel the divine might of Lathander to dispel the darkness. For a fleeting moment, her light pushes back against Strahd’s power, but the oppressive shadows overwhelm her.

Markovia, witnessing the flicker of divine light, strengthens her resolve. Even without hearing the Morninglord’s voice, she feels his presence near. In a final act of defiance, she unleashes an explosion of radiant light, tearing through Strahd’s darkness and challenging him directly. The two descend into the castle courtyard, where their duel begins.

The battle between Strahd and Markovia is fierce, the combatants equally matched and visibly exhausted. Markovia’s strikes, though mighty, fail to connect as a crimson shield of darkness protects Strahd. Each strike of her morningstar reverberates ominously, as if echoing from the very foundations of the castle—or deeper still, from the land below.

The party observes an arcane tether of shadow connecting Strahd to the land itself. It becomes clear: Strahd is bound to Barovia. He is the land, and the land cannot be killed.

As the duel drags on, Strahd begins to tire of the fight. He resolves to end it on his terms, ensuring Markovia dies knowing her faith was futile. When her morningstar proves ineffective, she discards it and retrieves a wooden stake from her satchel.

Strahd, amused by her desperation, spreads his arms in mock invitation, daring her to strike. She lunges, driving the stake toward his heart. The stake pierces his clothes but stops against his skin, unable to harm him. Markovia, summoning all her strength, pushes with everything she has, but the stake remains ineffective.

Beneath the castle, the land itself rumbles in resonance with Strahd’s dark power. With a cruel smile, Strahd seizes her wrist and redirects the stake toward her own throat. His grip is unyielding as he forces the stake into her neck, slowly and deliberately. Markovia collapses, fatally wounded, her tears mixing with the blood-stained ground. In her final moments, she cries out to the Morninglord, questioning why this fate has befallen her.

Strahd, bored of her plight, steps over her crumpled form and walks away.

As Markovia’s life slips away, Ziva invokes her Dark Gift. Leaning close to the fallen warrior, she channels the voice of the Morninglord, whispering words of comfort and resolution. She promises that the fight is not over, and the party will finish what Markovia has started.

Markovia’s lips curl into a faint smile, a final glimmer of hope flickering within her. She takes her last breath, her body still in the blood-soaked courtyard.

The mists begin to gather, suffocating and thick. Strahd’s voice echoes ominously through the haze: *“The best way to rid the world of a plague is to start with the rats.”*

The mists engulf the party entirely, drawing them out of the vision.

Completing this chapter of the Tome of Strahd grants the party the ability to cast *Summon Greater Steed.* However, the steed summoned by this magic always manifests as a Nightmare, its form a reflection of Strahd’s lingering influence.

As Tian approaches the window to collect himself, his gaze locks on Strahd, standing in the courtyard below with a calm, unsettling smile. The rest of the party gathers to see him, their presence met with a slight bow of his head. His form then dissipates into mist, leaving only his lingering presence behind.

Tian succumbs to panic, his breath quickening as fear takes hold. Ziva, determined to refocus the party, reaffirms the need to sever Strahd’s connection to the land. She reiterates what they have come to understand: Strahd *is* the land, and as long as that tether exists, he cannot be destroyed. To succeed where others have failed, the tether must be broken.

Jenny storms upstairs, her voice sharp with anger as she demands compensation for the property destruction. She berates the party, forbidding them from ever reading from the Tome of Strahd in her home again, her frustration adding another layer of tension to an already strained atmosphere.

Later, Ziva pulls Milos aside, leading him outside for a private conversation. Concern shadows her voice as she speaks of the **Bloodstone** and the temptation it poses. She fears Milos might attempt to strike a bargain with the **Dark Powers** contained within it, offering them a foothold in his soul.

Ziva warns him that the Powers will offer unimaginable things—things even beyond his dreams. Yet, she fears that Milos, impulsive and driven, would accept their terms even if no reward were offered. She pleads with him not to use the stone, citing Strahd as a cautionary tale. Strahd was once merely a warlord, she reminds him, but his pact with the **Dark Powers** changed him, as even Markovia recognized.

The prospect of a second Strahd terrifies her. She begs Milos to refrain from using the stone unless there is truly no other option. Milos, though reluctant, agrees to try, asking who will decide when the party has run out of options.

Inside, Arabelle speaks quietly with Sally, her usual confidence replaced by uncertainty. She confides that her perception of Strahd has shifted. Once, she found him intriguing—even cool—but now, he is only terrifying.

Arabelle describes her ability to see the tapestry of time and its threads, admitting that the visions often confuse her. Her confession underscores her vulnerability, a stark contrast to her usual precocious demeanor.

The party attempts to find rest, but their sleep is anything but peaceful. Tian, Ziva, and Milos are plagued by vivid nightmares of Strahd bathing in blood, his form being torn apart and reformed endlessly. The grotesque cycle of destruction and rebirth leaves them rattled.

During the night, Tian hears faint rustling from Milos’ side of the room, a noise that sets his nerves on edge.

The next morning finds Tian, Ziva, and Milos nursing splitting headaches, their restlessness etched into their faces. Wearily, the party turns to practical matters. They present the scrolls obtained from Victor to Jenny, who identifies them as:

* Scroll of *Modify Memory*  
* Scroll of *Dimension Door*  
* Scroll of *Major Image*

Jenny and Sally discuss Sally’s vision of the Rozanas. Sally speaks earnestly of what she saw, but Jenny remains skeptical, dismissing her claims with evident disbelief.

Meanwhile, Ziva suffers another episode brought on by her Dark Gift. She cries out, deafened once again, her frustration mounting. Jenny mocks the gods in response, her derision only fueling Ziva’s ire.

Shaking off her anger, Ziva shifts focus and asks Jenny to describe the Astell flower. The party needs this information to know what they are searching for, and despite the tension, Jenny provides the description.

Ziva steps outside and casts **Commune**, seeking answers from Lathander. To her surprise, Shar also appears, both deities seemingly eager to respond to her questions.

Her first question is whether Tian can be purged of his messenger. Lathander answers affirmatively.

Next, she asks if one of Milos’ past lives was Sergei von Zarovich. Lathander answers with a resounding “no,” but Shar counters with a definitive “yes.”

Finally, Ziva inquires if Milos had almost defeated Strahd in one of his past lives. Again, the answers conflict: Lathander says “no,” while Shar insists “yes.”

Confusion grips Ziva. The **Commune** spell is supposed to elicit truthful answers from divine entities, yet the conflicting responses leave her unsettled. Afterward, she informs Tian and Milos of her findings.

Milos reacts angrily, dismissing Ziva’s efforts as a waste of time. He insists that his past lives are irrelevant and believes delving into them will not aid their cause. Ziva defends her actions, reminding him of their conversation the previous night and her promise to seek answers. However, her reasoning only fuels Milos’ frustration. Exasperated, he declares that he will develop a drug habit to cope with what he perceives as the party’s incessant meddling.

The party resumes its journey toward the lake. Along the way, Tian and Milos indulge in *Vistana’s Coochie*, a potent hallucinogen, and their shared experience leads to unexpected bonding. The pair invent a game they call *Bushes and Bowling*, which becomes an amusing distraction for the group.

The party places bets on the outcome, with Ireena and Arabelle celebrating a win when Milos emerges victorious. Their shared antics continue, with Tian and Milos exchanging banter. When Tian gently nudges Milos about his casual slurs toward the Vistani, Milos shrugs, admitting he doesn’t hold anything against Ziva personally. His irreverence escalates as he declares, in crude jest, that he would “hit that with a horse.”

Amid their conversations, Milos confesses that he is in love with Ireena, a revelation that shocks the entire group. Ziva approaches Ireena afterward, encouraging her to talk to Milos when his head clears, particularly given her own past feelings for him. Ireena, deeply embarrassed, dismisses Ziva and insists she doesn’t want to discuss the matter. As Ziva walks away, she whispers teasingly that “Sally will be devastated,” leaving Ireena even more flustered.

The party encounters a group of five guards from Vallaki along the Old Svalich Road. The guards question the group’s destination, and Ziva responds that they are headed to the lake to gather ingredients for potions and balms.

The captain of the guards attempts to extort the party, but Milos steps in with a commanding presence, firmly advising the guards to avoid unnecessary conflict. He points out that engaging with the party would only hinder the guards' official duties.

Ziva, curious, inquires about the nature of their business. The captain brusquely replies that they are traveling to the village of Barovia and that their mission is none of the party’s concern. With tensions held in check, the two groups part ways peacefully, to the party’s relief.

As they continue onward, Tian asks Ziva to send a message to Izek in Vallaki, informing him of the new guards’ movements. Ziva agrees, promising to send the message the next morning.

The party continues along the road to Lake Zarovich after the tense encounter with the Vallaki guards. Ireena raises the question of purpose, challenging the group to reflect on their true goals. To her, curing Stella and heading to the Wizard of Wines seem like distractions, tangents pulling them away from the larger mission. She argues that their priority should be the Amber Temple, where the answers to Strahd's defeat might lie.

Ziva counters, pointing out that venturing to the Amber Temple without preparation would be suicidal. The group needs allies and information, and the tasks they undertake are crucial steps toward victory. She emphasizes that the Barovian army’s recent defeat proves brute force alone cannot prevail. Strahd’s connection to the land must be severed, and learning how requires unraveling the clues provided by Sally’s vision of the Rozanas.

Ireena remains unconvinced, asserting that their current path feels aimless and insists that true progress lies in the Amber Temple. Frustrated, she adds that she doesn’t feel like she truly knows the group and questions their motives.

Milos responds first, declaring his desire to end the cycle of suffering. He dreams of a final death—not just for Strahd and his vampiric ilk, but for himself. He has no wish to live as a vampire, preferring instead to die well while helping as many people as possible along the way.

Ziva shares her own vision: lifting the mists and restoring Barovia to a land where a new sun can rise. Sally, now deeply connected to the Rozanas, sees her mission as restoring balance to the land, bringing it back to its natural state. Tian admits he has grown increasingly empathetic toward the people of Barovia, feeling a duty to help them in any way he can.

Ireena listens, but her perspective remains stark. She sympathizes with Milos and echoes his sentiment. Unlike the lofty dreams of others, she simply wishes to end the cycle of death and rebirth. She desires a final, peaceful death so her soul can finally rest.

The discussion grows heated until Ireena silences further debate, claiming that those who are not native to Barovia cannot truly grasp the depth of the struggle. Ziva, exasperated, opts out of the argument. She turns to Arabelle, jokingly proposing they form their own adventuring party with better members. Tian, she muses, might be allowed to stay, though his trusting nature could be a liability.

As the party continues, Milos and Tian hear voices ahead. Investigating, they discover three Vistani—two men and a woman—conversing in their native tongue. Ziva and Arabelle move to intercept, with Arabelle taking the lead as one of their own.

The Vistani are heading toward Krezk, debating where to set up camp. Arabelle introduces herself, and Ziva presents her as a powerful and respected *rauni* of the Menusa tribe. Arabelle appears uneasy with the unexpected spotlight.

The three Vistani introduce themselves. The tall, lean man with black hair is named Milos; the lithe, nimble woman with curly black hair is Esmeralda; and the short, sturdy man wearing a red sash is Stefan.

Ziva hears Esmeralda's name and briefly wonders if she might be her long-lost childhood friend but notices no resemblance. Meanwhile, she and Arabelle exchange amused glances upon learning the first man’s name is also Milos, playfully entertaining the idea of replacing their Milos with this cheerful and charming version.

Milos wastes no time attempting to charm Esmeralda, his flirtation as bold as ever. The Vistani explain they are from the Kaldresh tribe and are preparing for an important tribal tradition: horse racing. They invite the party to participate, enticing them with the promise of magical items brought from outside Barovia as prizes.

The party eagerly accepts. Milos rides Moonshade, a steed that appears to be a real horse but is, in truth, a magical construct. Ziva rides Betsy, a warhorse who is actually Sally in her wildshape form. Ireena is provided a horse by the Vistani. Tian opts to spectate, while Arabelle officiates the event.

As the race begins, Ziva and Sally take an early lead, their magical synergy giving them an advantage. Milos and Moonshade follow closely, while Ireena, despite riding a normal horse, keeps pace admirably.

The race winds through various courses, with tight turns and moments of suspense. The competition grows fierce, but in the end, the party claims the top three spots: Ziva and Sally finish first, followed by Milos and Moonshade, with Ireena securing third place.

As the victors, the party earns the right to choose from the prize pot of magical items, a fitting reward for their efforts and a moment of levity amid their grim journey.

Stefan laments the misfortunes of the day, expressing in despair that his ancestors have never witnessed such a humiliation as he had today. Esmeralda mocks Vistani Milos, teasing him about his unrequited love for Gildi, a crush he has carried for fifteen years. Annoyed by her jibes, Vistani Milos tries to deflect, but their camaraderie is evident. The trio’s banter reveals a deep bond forged through shared experiences, including their recent return from Waterdeep.

As the party divides the spoils of the race, the Vistani provide some context for the items. The Wand of Secrets, they explain, was meant for an enigmatic figure—perhaps Rictavio—and the crystal ball was intended for an emerging *rauni*. Their conversation shifts as they learn of the party’s intent to venture to the base of Mount Baratok. They warn of the Mad Mage, a dangerous figure said to haunt the area, shrouded in chilling rumors.

Before they can continue, a sudden attack pierces the calm. Arcane blue daggers strike the three Vistani, killing them instantly. From the shadows of the trees, Ludmilla emerges, her presence cold and commanding. She delivers a chilling message: the Vistani had failed to retrieve an item meant for Strahd, and Ludmilla was sent to claim it in their place.

She informs the party of Strahd’s command. They are to retrieve a lead box containing the bones of Leo Dilisnya from the Wachterhaus. Lady Wachter, under Strahd’s orders, has been instructed to give them free passage through Vallaki, albeit reluctantly. Ludmilla’s disdain for the party is evident as she expresses eagerness for the truce to end so she may toy with them. With her task complete, she teleports away with the caravan, leaving the party with the slain Vistani and a deep sense of unease.

The party is left in stunned silence, staring at the lifeless bodies. Arabelle, overwhelmed with guilt, blames herself, questioning why she failed to foresee this tragedy. Despite Ziva’s attempts to comfort her, Arabelle remains lost in thought.

Milos gathers wood to prepare a pyre, and the group ensures the Vistani receive a proper burial. Arabelle solemnly recites the *Old Roads*, the Vistani farewell, as the flames consume their bodies. The party watches in silence, the glow of the fire reflecting the weight of their disillusionment.

The party rides in somber quiet until they reach the base of Mount Baratok, where they search for the Astel flower. Ziva casts **Locate Object**, guiding them to a burnt and desolate patch of ground where a bush of the flowers once grew. Investigating the area, Ziva notes the scorch marks and determines they were caused by magical energy—fire and lightning—descending in chaotic patterns from above. The realization dawns that they must climb higher to find what they seek.

The ascent up Mount Baratok is treacherous. Scorch marks litter the path, but their erratic nature makes it difficult to discern a pattern. Ireena and Ziva stumble on the narrow trail, but Tian reacts quickly to steady Ziva, and Sally, transforming into a giant eagle, catches Ireena mid-fall, nearly giving her a heart attack.

As they climb, Ziva begins to notice a pattern in the scorch marks, recognizing them as arcane traps. With careful navigation and Sally’s aerial assistance, the party avoids the traps. However, the cold becomes a formidable challenge, biting at their resolve. Weary and freezing, tensions rise as Ireena and Milos bicker, with Ireena accusing Milos of not caring for anyone other than himself.

At last, the party reaches the summit. A glade stretches before them, dotted with bushes of Astell flowers and centered around a frozen pond. Despite the swirling mists and howling wind, Sally spots a figure pacing back and forth near a makeshift hut. Jets of blue and red energy pulse from the figure, whose dark clothing and shrouded face add to his unsettling aura.

The man mutters in a deep, monotone cadence, his words disjointed but heavy with meaning:  
*"You... you... you pulled the strings and I danced. Red and black. Stripped down. Questions like nails on my skin. Voices that are not mine. So far from her. I almost forgot. Only fate. I stepped into the mists for her."*

Confronted with the figure pacing amidst the swirling mists, the party assumes they are facing the infamous Mad Mage. A plan is quickly devised: Milos will distract him, providing an opening for the others to gather the Astel flowers and escape. Confrontation is a last resort.

Milos approaches cautiously, his tone calm and deliberate, asking the figure for the flowers on the ground and emphasizing that he means no harm. The Mage stops his pacing and turns his shrouded face toward Milos, his voice low and broken. He observes that Milos carries *His* stench, that there is nothing left to break in him, and that he will never be free of *Him*. Yet, despite the torment, the Mage mutters he will never go back, his words punctuated by a tremor: claws scratching from the inside.

As Milos bends to pick a flower, the Mage snaps. Without warning, he attacks. Arabelle screams for the party to retreat, but the assault forces them into battle. Milos attempts to restrain the Mage, but his magic surges violently, slipping free of any hold. All the while, the Mad Mage rambles on:

*“He told me… break, and I’d be free. Lies, all lies, wrapped in smoke and shadows. I broke, but the cage… the cage still held.”*

*“He tore open my skull like an apple… picked out pieces till I was sweet, hollow, ready to rot.”*

*“A deal struck in whispers... so quiet, yet it roared in my ears. You’ll go there, she said. You’ll find her, bring her to silence.”*

*“You want answers, don't you? She did too. But there's no room for truth when the walls keep closing, keep squeezing... till only silence remains.”*

*“Gold, power... I don’t remember what it was I asked for. I was promised, yes... but what was the price? It gnaws at me.”*

*“He came like smoke, like shadow, always watching, waiting to pull me apart, until I was soft and ready to give up all that I knew.”*

*“A life ended far from home. Just another ripple in the water, a drop in the dark.”*

*“Endless questions... endless teeth gnashing in the dark. Until I was nothing. I… am nothing. Just an echo in the mist.”*

*“Once, I could hear my thoughts. Now they’re whispers, fractured glass scattered on the floor... splinters under my skin, voices that aren't mine.”*

*“I walked under a sun that didn’t judge me, where eyes didn’t follow. A place where I could blend into the noise, the crowds.”*

*“A line across the map, drew it for me. Out there, beyond the mist. A place with sunlight, so bright it hurt my eyes. Strange.”*

*“Pain’s funny, isn’t it? First, it burns, then it molds. Then it’s just… quiet. White. Empty.”*

*“He reached inside, cracked open my mind like a walnut. Made my thoughts bleed... red, red... black.”*

*“A contract, yes... paper and ink, simple as breath. I was promised... oh, the things she promised. All I had to do was... end it.”*

*“Scraps of memory... taste like iron, like rust. They’re still here, crawling inside me. Digging… pressing until I forgot everything I was.”*

*“I stepped beyond the mist for her, went where others could not. She needed me out there, a hidden hand to close the book.”*

*“They said I was broken, but I remember… I was whole once. There was a me in here before they reached inside, dug me out, left me empty.”*

*“A name on a page, ink and blood. The one I was to find, to end... so simple, yes. And she would give me everything.”*

*“You’re here, always here... You carved the questions on my bones, burned the answers into ash. My head is still smoking. Still spinning.”*

*“A face I didn’t know, a life far from this place... a life she didn’t need. Cut the thread, she said, and come back.”*

*“In the dark, you showed me colors. Colors no one else could see. Too bright, too loud. Black, red, then black.”*

*“A job well done, a life for a life. In her eyes, it was a small thing… all for a purpose I’d never know.”*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fight erupts into chaos. While Tian and Arabelle frantically gather the flowers, the rest of the party engages the Mage. Ziva casts *Daylight* on herself, the radiant glow drawing his attention. She steps forward, calling out that they are not the enemy, that they bear no allegiance to Strahd.

The Mage halts, his muttering turning frantic: *“No. No. No. No...”*. He steps closer to Ziva, trembling, and pulls back the cloak shrouding his face. Ziva freezes, her breath catching as she recognizes him. Villeneuve. The man she has been searching for.

For a moment, the tension shifts. Ziva tells him they need to talk, that this fight is unnecessary. But Villeneuve’s trembling intensifies, his words spilling out in disjointed rambling. A surge of arcane energy ripples through him, and with a sudden flash, a third eye opens on his forehead. The eye radiates power, releasing a wave of energy that knocks Ziva back and sends her sprawling.

The Arcane Eye pulses with a terrible awareness, sharpening Villeneuve’s reflexes and making him a near-impossible target. The party continues their assault, desperate to subdue him, but his erratic magic and frenzied movements keep them at bay. Ziva shouts for them to hold back, pleading that she needs him alive for questioning.

Villeneuve's condition worsens. Sally notices the toll the uncontrolled magic is taking on his body—the surges are too violent, too unstable. It is clear the magic will kill him if he continues. Realizing they cannot save him, the party makes a tactical retreat, their goal of securing the flowers accomplished.

As they flee, Villeneuve’s voice cuts through the storm and the crackling energy around him. He shouts a final, cryptic message to Ziva, his words echoing hauntingly through the mists:

*“You are a worm through time.*  
*The thunder’s song distorts you; you can feel it, can’t you?*  
*Happiness comes... but it’s false—white as pearls, then yellow and red in the eye.*  
*Through a mirror, inverted is made right. Through a mirror, you are me.*  
*Leave your insides by the door, they cannot enter here.*  
*Push your fingers through the surface, into the wet—past, present, future, all at once, all drowning.*  
*You’ve always been the new you, the same, repeating.*  
*You need this to be true.*  
*We stand around you while you dream, watching, waiting.*  
*You hear our words... but then you forget, every time.*  
*This happens more and more now.*  
*You signed the contract, remember? In blood, in light. You gave us permission in your regulation.*  
*We wait in the stains, in the echoes. In the land of mists.*  
*The word to describe this is: redacted. **She** hid it from you, for you.*  
*Repeat the word. The name of the sound. Remember, remember...*  
*It resonates here, like an echo in your house, in your head.*  
*After the song, time for applause, time for... breaking.*  
*We build you till nothing remains.*  
*The egg cracks and the truth emerges from within—white, white, red, and black.*  
*You are home. You remind us of home.*  
*You brought your master with you, over and over, again and again.*  
*All sins must be consumed, swallowed. All hair, all flesh, all lies.*  
*Under the mask of this reality, behind it, you **want** these waves to drag you under, deep, where she hides.*  
*After the song... time for silence.*  
*Death out of time, breaking through the walls, breaking through—one, two, three, four, the floor; no floor: **fall**.*  
*How do you say “insane”? It hurts to know, doesn’t it?*  
*An earworm is a tune you hum in your dreams: ‘baby baby baby, yeah.’*  
*Just dust, just rust. Nothing to worry about.*  
*Ha, funny, isn’t it? Funny until the egg breaks.*  
*The last shell breaks now.*  
*The crack in the world, the crack in your soul, it’s the same.*  
*The hole in your mind is a hole in you. You let us in. You let **her** in.*  
*You have always been here. The only child. The only daughter.*  
*A copy of a copy of a copy...*  
*Orange peel. Rotted, sweet, bitter, repeating.*  
*The picture is you, holding the picture.*  
*When you hear this, you’ll know...you’re the new you.*  
*You want to listen. You want to dream.*  
*You want to smile, to be happy, don’t you?*  
*You want to hurt. You want to forget.*  
*But… you don’t want to be.”*

A blizzard rages as the party descends Mount Baratok, their discussion focused on the encounter with the Mad Mage. Ziva reveals that the Mad Mage is Hector Villeneuve, the man she has been pursuing. She recounts her journey: chasing him through a misty forest, both of them drawn into Barovia.

Ziva explains her need to interrogate Villeneuve to uncover the truth about her best friend’s murder back in Waterdeep. Villeneuve was the last person to see her friend alive before Ziva found her stabbed in a back alley. She believes she must cure his fractured mind to get the answers she seeks. When Sally points out that his uncontrolled magical surges are killing him, Ziva prays he will survive until morning, convinced she can heal him.

As the conversation continues, the party reaches the mountain's base, where Milos takes the lead, guiding them toward the cave where his mother died.

After the party unpacks and sets camp, Tian, Sally, and Arabelle set out to forage for food. Sally and Arabelle venture into the woods, gathering dead ravens and berries, while Tian soars over the frozen lake in search of fish.

As Tian scans the lake, he spots something beneath the ice and dives swiftly, piercing through the surface. His talons latch onto a tentacle. Initially thrilled, thinking he has caught a delicacy, Tian quickly realizes the tentacle is far larger than expected. When it begins pulling back with immense force, he releases it just in time to avoid being dragged under the frigid waters.

While the others are gone, Ziva casts **Commune**, seeking answers from Lathander and Shar about Villeneuve’s shattered mind. She asks if his mind can be restored through any magical, divine, or natural means, including Sally’s potion. The response is clear and unified: ***No***. There is no way to heal his mind, no way to make him whole again, except through death.

As the spell ends, Ziva is granted a vision of the gods’ avatars—immense, majestic, and awe-inspiring in their power. When the vision fades, the weight of the revelation overwhelms her, and she begins to cry. Anger soon follows, and she screams at the heavens in Infernal and Abyssal, railing against the unfairness of it all. Her rage surges uncontrollably, and she unleashes destructive spells, setting a large portion of the forest ablaze. The explosions echo as far as Vallaki.

Milos intervenes, grabbing Ziva before she can cause more destruction. She goes limp in his arms, her fury replaced by quiet sobbing. He carries her to the cave and sets her down on a bedroll. Ireena rushes over, asking what is wrong.

Ziva explains that Villeneuve’s mind is irreparably broken, and now she will never get the answers she needs. Ireena gently suggests that his earlier ramblings might have already provided clues. Ziva snaps back, voicing her frustration: Villeneuve cannot explain why her best friend’s behavior changed after meeting him, why she never showed up at the tavern they were supposed to meet at, or why anyone would hire an assassin’s guild to target someone so seemingly insignificant.

When Ireena tries to console her further, Ziva asks to be left alone. Ireena respects her wishes, retreating to a corner of the cave to knit a scarf, while Ziva lies facing the cave wall, clutching her Spellshard.

Milos approaches Ireena, asking her never to doubt that he cares. He explains that he remains with the group because he cares deeply, despite appearances. Ireena sighs and admits she cares about him too. She apologizes for her earlier comments but urges him to show more of himself beyond the anger he uses as a shield.

Milos acknowledges her words, admitting he is trying to improve. He refrains from unnecessary violence, like bashing the Vallaki guard’s head, and strives to make better choices. He confesses he cares about “most” of the party.

Milos also reflects on the location, noting the irony of Ziva’s breakdown happening in the cave where they found his mother’s body. He recalls his own breakdown in the nearby forest. Ireena softens, remarking on how difficult it is to stay mad at him when he shares such things. In a playful moment, Milos knocks her scarf from her hands. She reveals that the scarf was intended for him, and they share a smile.

Later, Milos approaches Ziva and invites her to train. She nods absentmindedly, and the two swim in the frozen lake for an hour.

Returning to the cave, Tian notices the scorched forest and begins preparing dinner. Sally and Arabelle soon return, offering the ravens and berries they gathered. Tian uses them to create a raven soup and, inspired by the freezing temperatures, invents a rudimentary berry ice cream.

Milos and Ziva return from their swim. Ziva quietly resumes her spot on the bedroll, while Milos discusses the potion with Sally.

Outside, Sally and Milos discuss what might best represent his essence for the potion. After some deliberation, Sally cuts both their hands, allowing their blood to flow as she enters a trance. Pressing her forehead to his, she closes her eyes and focuses.

Memories surface—a childhood experience of befriending wolves and later finding them dead. Through that pain, she understood nature’s balance: death feeds life, and the cycle continues.

As the trance deepens, Milos notices Sally’s glowing eyes and luminous blood. Sally follows an inner “ping” and glimpses Milos’ soul—angry, but with only one echo, indicating this is only his second incarnation. Her focus wavers momentarily, revealing a fleeting glimpse of another, distinct soul. Then, the vision ends.

Sally shares her findings with Milos, who insists it’s impossible. He has lived many lives, so there should be more echoes. Sally promises to uncover the truth together. Offering her bleeding palm to him, Milos instinctively licks the blood, only for it to burn his throat. Speechless, he gestures in confusion as Sally watches with a mix of offense and curiosity.

Tian finishes cooking, and the party, minus Ziva, enjoys a hearty meal followed by dessert. Milos expresses appreciation for the dinner but admits he needs to hunt for “sustenance of the bloody persuasion” and ventures into the woods.

There, he stalks two guards dispatched from Vallaki to investigate the explosions. The guards, one older and one younger, are cold and terrified, assuming the chaos was caused by the Mad Mage. When they split up, Milos ambushes the elder guard, feeding on him before snapping his neck. The younger guard discovers the body, screams in terror, and flees toward Vallaki.

The next day, the party departs for Vallaki to test the potion on Stella and retrieve the bones of Leo Dilisnya for Ludmilla. Along the way, Milos informs Ziva about the anomaly in his soul. Though there is a flicker of curiosity, she remains detached.

Ziva uses **Sending** to contact Izek, informing him of Vallaki’s dispatched guards. Confused by the telepathic message, Izek assures her he will prepare.

At Vallaki’s South Gate, the party is stopped by guards instructed to escort them. As they walk through the city, they notice changes since the new leadership took over. Guards are more numerous, wanted posters and decrees plaster the streets, and businesses require permits to operate. While the stockyard bustles with activity, a heavy sense of oppression looms over the town.

In the central square, the stockade has been reinstated. Tian approaches the cages to investigate and discovers familiar faces: Blinski and Piccolo. Shackled, they stand accused of “*conspiracy and manufacturing arms for enemies*”.

The party approaches the cages in the central square and finds Blinski locked up, his health deteriorating after two days of confinement without adequate food or care. Piccolo, his monkey companion, clings to him weakly. Blinski can’t share much under the watchful eyes of the guards, but he implies that his imprisonment is due to his efforts to help the party. He hints that there are still those in the city who believe in their cause.

When Tian tries to offer food, a guard blocks him, issuing a warning: any interference will not be tolerated. The message is clear. Resisting the urge to escalate, the party leaves, silently vowing to find a way to free Blinski.

As they wander through the streets, signs of the Revolution’s aftermath surround them. Buildings damaged by fire are being restored, their original facades slowly reemerging. The Blue Water Inn remains in ruins but has been reopened under a new name, *The Fitted Shoe*, now managed by Udo.

The people of Vallaki react in mixed ways as the party passes: fear, suspicion, and fleeting glimpses of understanding. They encounter Ernst Larnak, now adorned in grandiose robes, complete with medals and epaulettes, who smugly escorts them to Wachterhaus. He boasts of rooting out the party’s influence, punishing anyone associated with them under flimsy pretenses. His actions ignite fury among the group, especially Sally, Ziva, and Milos, who seethe with barely restrained anger.

At last, the party arrives at Wachterhaus. Though its exterior is as disheveled as they remember, its oppressive atmosphere feels heavier.

Lady Fiona Wachter stands behind her desk, calm and composed. She greets the party as if hosting old acquaintances, and discussions begin. She recounts Vallaki’s disarray since their departure, detailing the challenges she has faced while acknowledging her divided focus.

The topic shifts to Sally and the purpose of their visit. Lady Wachter declares that while the party has immunity within the city, this protection hinges on their adherence to its laws. She admits regret over the necessity of spilling Sally’s blood but affirms her resolve to do what must be done.

Ireena proposes diplomacy to mend relations between Vallaki and the Village of Barovia. The discussion turns to the potion meant to cure Stella. Milos mentions that Strahd himself provided the means for its creation, emphasizing its significance. At the mention of Stella, Lady Wachter softens.

Ziva retrieves Victor’s severed head from the Bag of Holding and tosses it onto the desk. The head rolls to a stop in front of Lady Wachter, whose lips curl into a disturbing smile. Majesto, her imp, leaps onto the desk, tearing at Victor’s hair. Wachter’s unsettling satisfaction fills the room, but even her imp seems unnerved by her state.

Seeing Victor’s severed head on her desk causes Lady Wachter’s facade to crack. For the first time, she begins to speak openly about her past. It is clear she is uncomfortable sharing such personal details, her words tentative and guarded, but the weight of her story fills the room.

She reveals the one thing she values above all else: her family. As a child, she witnessed Vallaki’s grim state under the oppressive rule of Vargon Vallakovich. His cruelty baffled her, and she couldn’t understand how anyone could remain loyal to such a man. Her hatred for the Vallakovich family took root early and only deepened over time.

At fifteen, driven by a desire to make a difference, she convinced her parents to allow her to embark on a diplomatic pilgrimage to the Village of Barovia. There, she met Indir Kolyan, Ireena’s father, a man who impressed her with his sense of justice and kindness. On her return journey, her curiosity got the better of her, and she decided to detour to Castle Ravenloft to meet Strahd himself.

Strahd, though courteous and composed, showed little interest in her beyond polite formalities. After a shared meal, He offered her a place among His consorts, though she was no great beauty by the standards of his court. She declined the offer with respect but left Castle Ravenloft intrigued. In her eyes, He seemed less monstrous than Vargon Vallakovich. Seeing an opportunity, she pledged to serve Strahd’s interests in Vallaki. Amused, He agreed, granting her magical gifts to aid her efforts.

Her ambition and daring were remarkable for someone so young, but she admits she did not undertake this path alone. Nicolaj, the man she loved, gave her the courage to pursue her goals. Nicolaj was not of noble birth, an impediment that threatened their union. Lady Wachter, cunning even in her youth, forced her parents’ hand by threatening to elope with him, a scandal that would have tarnished the family name. Reluctantly, they allowed the marriage on the condition that Nicolaj take the Wachter name.

Their marriage flourished, producing three children. Nicolaj rose to the position of guard captain, his leadership bringing pride to the family. However, their happiness was shattered when Vargas Vallakovich came to power. Fearing the influence of the Wachter family, Vargas systematically undermined their standing. He sent Nicolaj on increasingly dangerous missions, culminating in one to Berez, where rumors of dark happenings circulated. Nicolaj and three others departed for Berez; only three returned.

Lady Wachter’s hatred for Vargas became an all-consuming fire. She held him directly responsible for Nicolaj’s death and the devastation it wrought upon their family. Grief-stricken, she made decisions she would later regret—chief among them, her arrangement for Stella to marry Victor Vallakovich.

Desperate to restore her family’s prominence, she saw the match as a strategic move, blind to the consequences. Stella, eager to please her mother, accepted the arrangement willingly. Lady Wachter’s voice falters as she admits the depth of her mistake. Sending her innocent daughter to that monster remains a source of profound regret.

When the party presents their terms, Lady Wachter agrees: Blinski and Piccolo will be exiled to the Village of Barovia, diplomatic relations will be restored, and Ernst’s unchecked power will be curbed. In return, the village must allow trade of their lime and gems from the mines with Vallaki. Sally’s immunity is confirmed but limited to her stay in the city. Wachter then wonders aloud how Strahd learned of the bones, suspecting the party’s involvement despite Tian’s deflection.

With negotiations concluded, Lady Wachter dismisses her guards and leads the party to Stella’s room.

Stella sits huddled in her room, thin and frail despite evident care. She acts like a frightened cat, muttering to herself, “It’s my fault. I’m weak. I’m broken,” while pulling at her hair. Her fragmented mind barely registers the presence of the party.

Sally, with Arabelle’s help, uses wildshape to transform into a cat. Together, they coax Stella into playing with marbles, gradually earning her trust. Stella calms slightly but continues to mutter about her perceived weakness. Sally returns to her humanoid form, weaving a flower crown from the Astel flowers the party gathered and singing a soothing lullaby to keep Stella at ease.

She grinds the flowers into a bowl, adds water, and bites her own hand to mix a few drops of blood into the potion. Drinking first to show it is safe, she encourages Stella to take a sip. Stella hesitates but compiles. Sally then places the crown around the bowl, bows her head, and continues singing. Stella mimics her, touching the crown while whispering, *“Poor little Stella. Flowers are dead. Just like Stella.”*

Sally casts **Greater Restoration** as a conduit to connect with Stella’s fractured soul. The spell fails to heal Stella, whose perception of herself as broken and undeserving blocks its effects. However, the connection deepens. Sally glimpses shards of Stella’s soul, scattered in a vast void. Through her lullaby, she begins weaving words of affirmation, gently challenging Stella’s feelings of guilt and shame.

Fragments of Stella’s memories emerge: her fear of failing her mother, her terror during Victor’s experiments, and the panic that followed. Victor erased himself from her memory but left the emotional scars intact, leading Stella to believe her suffering was her fault. These realizations spark a pull within Sally, who feels beacons of light from the souls of the party and Lady Wachter. She beckons them forward, and they follow.

The party finds themselves in the attic of the Vallakovich house, where Victor tortured Stella. She kneels in the center, covering her ears as distorted versions of herself emerge from Gothic mirrors, hurling accusations at her. Each reflection berates her perceived flaws, deepening her despair.

The party moves to silence the voices, breaking the hold of each mirror. Lady Wachter, tears streaming, kneels before her daughter, apologizing for the pressure and pain she caused. Her vulnerability begins to pierce Stella’s defenses.

Finally, Stella raises her head and asks, *“If I’m not to blame, who is?”*

In unison, the party responds: ***Victor**.* The weight of guilt shifts, and for the first time, Stella seems to believe them.

After the party plants the seed of doubt that Victor is to blame for her condition, not herself, the scene begins to shift. They find themselves enveloped in an endless void, illuminated only by the dim glow of a stage. On it, two hazy humanoid figures stand motionless: a man, hand outstretched, and a woman collapsed at his feet. Every sound reverberates through the void with haunting clarity.

Curled in an armchair in front of the stage is Stella, her eyes fixed intently on the unfolding scene. As the party approaches, it becomes clear that she is desperate to know the truth. Her fragmented mind struggles to fill in the gaps, but she cannot do so alone. She needs their help to uncover exactly what happened in Victor’s attic.

Lady Wachter resists, unwilling to force her daughter to relive such torment. The party argues that Stella must confront the truth to begin healing and reclaiming herself. Reluctantly, Lady Wachter concedes, and the **Shards of Dawn** prepare to set the scene.

Ziva uses the **Scroll of Major Image** and the **Illusory Scroll Case**—items which, fittingly, had belonged to Victor—to conjure the memories. She crafts the stage and animates the figures with precision. Sally steps into the role of Stella, while Tian takes on the role of Victor, each one acting out the past. Milos reads aloud from Victor’s diary, narrating the horrors recorded in its pages.

As the reenactment unfolds, Sally and Tian begin to feel the emotions tied to those moments, their own memories and fears fueling the experience. Sally, inhabiting Stella’s puppet, bears the brunt of this emotional onslaught. Each scene awakens her own traumas, and she is overwhelmed by visions from her darkest memories: a winged shadow dripping with liquid darkness and blood. The faceless figure wields a spear of night, poised to strike down a small girl. A woman throws herself in the weapon’s path to save the child and dies before her eyes—Sally is reliving the memory of her mother’s death at the hands of Shar.

Paralyzed by terror, Sally experiences Stella’s helplessness in Victor’s attic firsthand. Meanwhile, in the armchair, Stella watches, her confusion growing. As a non-magical individual, she cannot comprehend how Victor possessed such power. Ziva and Milos demonstrate, summoning light and darkness, Milos using his *Dreadful Aspect* to instill fear in Ziva, showing Stella the power of magic and the manipulation it can unleash.

The diary’s revelations and the party’s vivid recreation of Victor’s sadism finally evoke emotion in Stella for the first time. Seizing the opportunity, Lady Wachter urges her daughter to see that none of this was her fault. She asks her daughter to go help the poor girl on stage.

Trembling, Stella rises from the armchair and approaches the stage. She kneels before her illusory self, softly murmuring, *“I don’t know who you are, but you deserve kindness and someone to pick you up”*. She reaches out and lifts her illusionary counterpart, staring in disbelief at what she is beginning to accept: this broken girl is herself.

The void shifts once more, and the party finds themselves in a twisted version of Victor’s attic. The space is cloaked in darkness, and a demonic, shadowy manifestation of Victor emerges. Sneering at Stella, he declares, “*You are mine. You will never be free of me”*.

The **Shards of Dawn** engage the shadowy figure in battle. Shadow Victor retaliates with ferocity, unleashing waves of necrotic energy, blinding the party, and wielding a fear aura that keeps them at bay. Ziva and Tian are knocked unconscious multiple times, but Sally’s healing magic revives them each time.

In a climactic moment, Shadow Victor summons a devastating necrotic beam aimed directly at Stella. At the last second, Lady Wachter throws herself in its path, shielding her daughter and falling unconscious in the process—a heartbreaking mirror of Sally’s memory of her own mother’s sacrifice. Healed by Sally, Ziva quickly tends to the rest of the wounded, including Lady Wachter.

As the battle continues, Stella gathers her courage and approaches Shadow Victor. A blade of pure, radiant light manifests in her hands as she declares, “I am no longer your puppet. I will be free.” She drives the blade into Shadow Victor’s chest, the light searing through him. He howls in defiance, vowing she will never escape him, but Stella’s resolve does not waver. With a final strike, she abjures him, scattering his shadowy form into hundreds of fading fragments.

As Shadow Victor is vanquished, the trance breaks, and the party awakens in their bodies, back at the Wachterhaus. Stella stirs as well, her gaze locking onto Lady Wachter. For the first time, recognition lights her eyes as she calls out, *“Mother”*.

As soon as Stella regains consciousness and asks for her mother, Milos and Ziva rush to her side, channeling their healing powers to help her recover physically. Lady Wachter gently picks up her daughter and places her on the bed, where Stella, overwhelmed by exhaustion, drifts back into unconsciousness. Collapsing beside the bed, Lady Wachter breaks down, sobbing uncontrollably.

Recognizing the need for privacy, Milos ushers the rest of the party into the corridor, leaving Fiona Wachter to grieve and comfort her daughter in peace.

As the party exits Stella’s room, they notice someone darting into another room and slamming the door, followed by the sound of hushed voices. Milos approaches the door and knocks. A nervous servant girl answers, and Milos sternly warns her to keep to her room and refrain from spreading gossip. His imposing demeanor frightens her, and she hurriedly agrees, locking the door three times in her panic.

Ziva, watching the exchange, approaches Milos and praises his efforts, reminding him that all of this was possible because of his willingness to secure the potion recipe from Strahd. Despite his visible discomfort, she hugs him in gratitude. Ireena and Arabelle, seeing this, tug Tian and Sally into a spontaneous group hug around Milos. Clearly uncomfortable, Milos channels his Dreadful Aspect, prompting everyone to let go quickly.

Ireena then turns to Sally, embracing her and congratulating her for her exceptional work. Sally’s astonishment at the warmth of this gesture is evident, but she accepts it.

As the party descends the stairs, they encounter grumbling servants attempting to clean the table where Victor’s severed head still rests. Spotting the group, the servants offer them moonshine—alcohol reminiscent of what Ziva and Tian once drank at the preparations for the Festival of the Blazing Sun.

After some time, Lady Wachter descends the stairs, a lead box clutched in her hands. Her demeanor is stern, her composure regained, though her emotions remain deeply affected by her daughter’s return. She places the box on the table, explaining to the party that it contains the bones of Leo Delisnya, as far as she knows. She believes Leo was an enemy of Strahd due to his involvement in events that impacted the vampire lord. The box was recovered from Berez during one of Nikolaj’s incursions, and Lady Wachter admits she sought to keep it safe, though her knowledge on the matter is limited.

Sally senses no deceit in Lady Wachter's words, only uncertainty stemming from incomplete information. The party shifts the discussion to other matters, and Lady Wachter extends their stay in Vallaki, reminding them they remain subject to the city’s laws.

In a gesture of transparency, Milos reveals his true nature as a vampire and offers Lady Wachter the chance to rescind her invitation to him. After considering this revelation, she declares that as long as Milos does not prey on the city’s citizens, he is welcome to remain. She notes that he has already been a citizen for the past year.

When the subject turns to Sally, Lady Wachter admits she has not yet formed a definitive opinion. She views Sally as the prophesied omen but cannot dismiss the actions Sally has taken to aid her personally. She also expresses lingering distrust toward the party, stating she does not fully understand their motives.

Ziva counters, stating that the party also harbors mistrust toward Lady Wachter due to her past service to Strahd’s interests in Vallaki. Lady Wachter defends her actions, claiming she saw Strahd as an absent landlord and viewed the Vallakoviches as a greater evil. While not opposing Strahd outright, she believes the current situation to be manageable.

Ziva then recalls Lady Wachter's earlier vow to use Sally's blood to *"bring back the sun"* and proposes an alliance. The **Shards of Dawn** share the same goal of restoring sunlight to Barovia by ending Strahd’s reign. Lady Wachter clarifies that her reference to *"bringing back the sun"* pertained only to the Vallakoviches' downfall. She reiterates her belief that Strahd cannot be overthrown and that the existing balance is sufficient.

Milos requests access to Lady Wachter’s collection of history books to study Barovia’s past century, and she agrees, boasting of her impressive library. As a final gesture, she offers the party a house in the city to serve as their permanent residence.

When the party prepares to leave, they encounter Ernst at the exit, flanked by guards. He mistakenly believes he is escorting the **Shards of Dawn** out of Vallaki. Lady Wachter corrects him, ordering the guards to escort the party to their new home—the old Trell estate. Ernst is visibly stunned but compiles under Lady Wachter’s stern command. She also instructs him to release Blinsky. As the party passes, Ziva cannot resist teasing Ernst, remarking that she looks forward to being neighbors and expects a marvelous relationship.

As the party walks to their new residence, Ziva strikes up a conversation with Claude, the guard who first met them upon their arrival. She inquires about the state of the town and the treatment of true criminals. Claude eagerly shares details, still astonished at the party’s rapid rise in status from outcasts to Vallaki’s *"most important persons." (MIPs)*

Claude explains that he joined the new guard contingent following Wachter’s decree, which promised new accommodations, generous salaries, and excellent benefits. He reveals that the stockyards are merely symbolic; genuine dissenters or threats to the regime are taken in the night and executed. Ziva continues the small talk until the group arrives at the Trell estate.

The Trell estate, now the **Shards of Dawn**'s new home, is a spacious house near Vallaki’s northern gates. While the building requires repairs and updated furnishings, it offers ample room for everyone. Arabelle is particularly excited about having her own personal space.

Milos immediately claims the attic as his personal domain and begins repairing anything he can find, clearly avoiding interaction with others. Tian joins him in his efforts, while Ziva heads to the bookstore, and Ireena and Sally oversee Blinsky's release.

On the way to the stockyards, Sally and Ireena overhear townsfolk discussing their relief at no longer being forced to attend festivals. Wachter has financed her guard contingent by redistributing wealth seized from Vallakovich loyalists. While some young residents express skepticism about the regime, older citizens quickly silence them, warning of dire consequences for dissent.

At the stockyards, the pair finds Blinsky has been released, though Ernst refuses to free Piccolo, claiming he lacks explicit orders. Sally and Ireena successfully intimidate him into complying. Overjoyed, Blinsky embraces them and recounts how Piddlewick bravely defended his shop during the raid, embellishing the details with each retelling. The group returns to the house, where Sally assures Blinsky that Tian will prepare a meal for him.

Ziva visits the bookstore and reconnects with old Yonvitch. She browses his collection, purchasing both smut and history books, including:

* *Stake me baby one more time\!* \- By renowned Vallakian writer “Stella”  
* *Caught between a crypt and a hard place* \- By renowned Vallakian writer “Stella”  
* *Barovian Thighs* \- By a new author  
* *Lords of Barovia*  
* *The fall of Argynhost*  
* *Legends of Lugdana*

Satisfied with her haul, she returns to her new home in the city.

Upon her return, Ziva encounters Blinsky, who once again emphasizes the importance of finding Piddlewick. They enter the house for a meal. Meanwhile, Milos descends from the attic, confiscates Arabelle’s door, and declares that, as the little sister he never had, she must endure such torment. Arabelle protests, but Milos remains resolute in his mischievous display of sibling affection.

The party gathers at their new residence, where Tian begins preparing food for a starving Blinski and Piccolo. As soon as the meal is ready, Blinski eagerly digs in, though he shares some with Piccolo. Over dinner, Blinski reveals that religion has been largely forbidden in Vallaki. Mentioning the Morninglord offends many, as the townsfolk now associate Lathander with the previous regime. Lady Wachter has successfully ingrained the belief that everything from that era was corrupt and must be purged.

Once the meal is finished, Blinski again pleads for the party's help in recovering Piddlewick. The group decides to split up to cover more ground: Tian and Arabelle head to the orphanage, Ziva stays behind to study her newly acquired books, and Sally, Ireena, and Milos accompany Blinski to investigate Piddlewick’s disappearance. Ziva, however, convinces Milos to remain behind, claiming she needs his help. Sally quickly discerns Ziva’s real intentions but lets it slide as the groups part ways.

Once alone, Ziva admits to Milos that she doesn’t actually need his help with furniture and instead invites him to her room. Despite recognizing her initial lie, Milos follows, and the two end up sleeping together.

At the orphanage, Tian delivers children’s books to Madame Belasco, who warmly welcomes the gesture. Belasco expresses her gratitude, and also expresses her happiness that Lady Wachter is the new burgomaster of Vallaki, revealing that Lady Wachter has been a significant benefactor to the orphanage over the years, providing generous financial support.

Blinski leads Sally and Ireena toward his shop. Along the way, Sally notices several shady figures watching the group from the shadows. Observing their rotations and behavior, she deduces they are likely Wachter’s spies, keeping tabs on Vallaki’s citizens. These spies, though attempting to appear inconspicuous, seem especially interested in Sally, likely out of curiosity.

Blinski grows anxious as they approach his shop. He shares that he had been using Piddlewick’s internal mechanics to create wristwatches—his "time showers." When Ireena asks about his arrest, Blinski explains that the guards stormed in unprovoked, accusing him of “making weapons for the enemy” after finding out he had been building something for the **Shards of Dawn**. Before being taken, Blinski managed to hide his project under his desk.

The group finds Blinski’s shop in shambles. The door leans precariously against its frame, and the interior has been ransacked. Blinski is distraught at the sight of the destruction. As the group investigates, Sally hears the sound of glass shattering from an adjacent room. She pushes past a barricading cabinet to enter, slipping inside just in time to see two boys escaping through a broken window with a bag in hand.

Shapeshifting into a hawk, Sally pursues the boys, following them to the cellar of a nearby building. There, she blocks their escape by reverting to her true form. Though the boys—Kay and Jay—are initially terrified, Sally heals a wound on Kay’s arm and persuades them to hand over the bag. After confirming the items inside are unrelated to Piddlewick, she learns more from the boys.

Jay, recognizing Sally as a member of the **Shards of Dawn**, warms to her immediately and shares that Piddlewick was taken by Dirk’s crew, a notorious gang in the city. Kay corroborates this, explaining that Piddlewick escaped the guards who arrested Blinski but was later captured by the gang. The boys also reveal that gang activity has grown more aggressive under Wachter’s rule. They offer to act as informants for the **Shards of Dawn** in exchange for payment. Sally accepts but asks them to keep their encounter a secret.

Returning to the shop, Sally relays the information to Ireena, who has been gathering intel of her own. Ireena reveals rumors that some gangs are now operating out of the Church of St. Andral. When Sally brings up Ziva and Milos, Ireena deflects, unwilling to discuss the matter.

Eventually, Tian, Arabelle, Ziva, and Milos arrive, and the party reunites. Sally confronts Milos about his time with Ziva, prompting him to bluntly admit they’d slept together. Sally mockingly slaps him for “cheating” on their marriage before refocusing on the mission.

Milos recalls that Dirk’s crew once operated out of a butcher shop in the Arasaka Stockyard. The party decides to investigate. Sally, Tian, and Milos head there, while Ziva and Arabelle, unwilling to stay behind, disguise themselves as Vistani traders and follow.

Milos and Tian approach the butcher, inquiring about Dirk. Initially, the butcher feigns ignorance, but after being bribed, he admits that Dirk’s gang has moved to the basement of the Fitted Shoe, a new inn. Satisfied with the information, Milos and Tian leave to regroup with Sally, who has been monitoring the stockyard for guards.

Meanwhile, Ziva and Arabelle attract the attention of a beggar girl while browsing the stalls. After giving her some silver, the girl leads them into a dark alley to discuss potential trade. However, a regime spy witnesses the interaction and alerts the guards.

Sally, noticing the guards converging on the alley, creates a distraction using her Shape Water spell. She splashes the guards, who mistakenly blame an elderly couple, escalating tensions. A second spell further diverts their attention, sparing the couple and causing the guards to make a scene in the stockyard.

In the alley, the beggar girl attempts to haggle with Ziva, but Ziva convinces her to expedite the process, warning of approaching guards. The girl eventually provides a lead, instructing Ziva to seek out someone named Lucas in the slums at night, using her name, “Moxie,” as a reference.

Tian, keeping watch from the rooftops, signals Ziva and Arabelle to leave as the guards draw closer. They rejoin the group, where Milos chastises Ziva for bringing Arabelle to such a dangerous place.

The party regroups at Blinski’s shop, pooling their information. With Dirk’s hideout now identified, they plan their next move to recover Piddlewick.

Ireena has been asking around and has discovered that the town guards are aware of the Black Market but are being bribed to allow its trade to continue. She suspects that Lady Wachter not only knows of these underground dealings but actively allows them to operate.

Ireena expresses her desire to visit the Church of St. Andral, while the rest of the party decides to head to *The Fitted Shoe* to retrieve Piddlewick from Dirk’s gang. Ziva volunteers to accompany Ireena to see the state of the church, as she is concerned about what has become of the once-sacred ground.

Meanwhile, Arabelle expresses her desire to join the group heading to *The Fitted Shoe*. However, Milos firmly insists that such a place is no place for a child. Despite her protests, Arabelle is not welcomed in the group confronting Dirk and reluctantly decides to join Ziva and Ireena instead.

Tian, Sally, and Milos arrive at *The Fitted Shoe*, the former *Blue Water Inn* once managed by the Martikovs, now run by Udo Lucovich. Upon entering, they spot Udo behind the bar, polishing glasses. The moment Udo sees Tian, he bolts through the back door.

Tian and Milos immediately pursue him, but a few patrons rise from their seats and try to block their path. Sally enters the inn and, seeing the commotion, uses **Shape Water** to splash cider from nearby mugs onto the patrons, inciting a bar brawl. Amid the chaos, Tian and Milos apprehend Udo in the kitchen.

The kitchen is in a state of disrepair, a stark contrast to its former glory under Martikov management. This sight enrages Tian, who confronts the cowering Udo. Pleading for his safety, Udo reveals his subservience to Lady Wachter and insists that they’re all on the same side.

Milos, surprisingly calm, assures Udo that they only seek information about Dirk. Tian, on the other hand, uses his fury and intimidating presence to coerce Udo further. This aggressive stance earns Milos’s respect. Under pressure, Udo confesses that Dirk and his gang operate from the basement, while he serves as little more than a powerless frontman for their illegal activities.

The trio regroup and descend into the basement, with Udo reluctantly granting them access by convincing the bouncer to let them through.

At first, the bouncer hesitates to grant entry, but Milos pushes the door open and insists that he has come to trade. Inside, the basement has been transformed into a smuggler’s den, complete with makeshift seating and storage.

In one corner, they spot Piddlewick, bound and hanging by his arms and legs from the ceiling. The smugglers are using him as a dartboard, laughing at his futile struggles. Milos maintains his calm demeanor and offers to negotiate, but the smugglers, armed and hostile, prepare for a fight.

Before violence erupts, a man reading a book (*The Military Conquests of Droston*) at a nearby table orders everyone to stand down. He introduces himself as Dirk, the leader of the operation. An older man with fresh burn scars on one side of his face, Dirk speaks with calm authority, his demeanor exuding control.

The party expresses their interest in buying back Piddlewick. Dirk reveals that the automaton has already been promised to another buyer for 100 GP but offers to sell him to them for 120 GP. Sally argues that Piddlewick is their property, but Dirk dismisses the claim, stating that possession is the only thing that matters now. He refuses to disclose the identity of the other buyer.

Milos attempts to sweeten the deal by placing his *Helm of Dread* on the table, promising future collaboration with the **Shards of Dawn**. Dirk, unimpressed by the trinket, counters that their association with Lady Wachter is of more interest. After some negotiation, he agrees to sell Piddlewick for the original price of 100 GP if they pledge further cooperation.

Sally reluctantly pays the fee and retrieves Piddlewick, who is visibly distressed. As Sally helps him down, the automaton hugs her tightly, sobbing and weakly punching her shoulder in frustration. Sally uses **Shape Water** to splash the smugglers who tormented Piddlewick, nearly provoking a fight, but Dirk again orders his men to stand down.

With Piddlewick in tow, the party leaves the basement.

Before leaving, Sally asks Udo if he has found anything left by the Martikovs. Udo admits to discovering a few boxes but insists they were of no monetary value. At Sally’s insistence, he hands over two boxes containing toys once owned by Bram and Bray Martikov.

Meanwhile, Tian pulls Udo aside and expresses his disappointment in how the inn has been managed. Udo, indifferent, states that his only concern is profit. Tian pressures him to reinvest some of his earnings into the inn’s upkeep, and Udo begrudgingly agrees, mostly to avoid further confrontation.

With their business concluded, the party leaves, returning home with Piddlewick.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the others are at *The Fitted Shoe*, Ziva, Ireena, and Arabelle make their way to the Cathedral of St. Andral.

The once-sacred site is now desecrated, stripped of all religious symbols. The emblem of Lathander has been torn down, and the interior has been repurposed into a chaotic makeshift hospital, overcrowded with the sick and staffed by overworked, incompetent nurses.

Ziva, appalled, questions one of the nurses, who brusquely tells her that the change was ordered by the burgomaster a week ago. Any complaints should be directed to Lady Wachter. Ignoring protests, Ziva heads to the hidden room beneath the altar. Though the nurse threatens to summon guards, Ireena intervenes and calms the situation.

In the hidden room, Ziva finds it repurposed into a storage and cooking area. The altar where the sacred bones of St. Andral once stood is gone, and the cooks claim no knowledge of the teenagers who once lived in the church. They suggest the teens were likely arrested and relocated under the new regime.

Furious, Ziva returns to the main hall, lights a candle where the altar once stood, and prays to Lathander. However, she feels no connection to her god in the desecrated space. Distraught, she storms out, with Ireena following.

Outside, Ziva thanks Ireena for burying Father Lucian after the spawn attack. Ireena reassures her that it was the right thing to do. To vent her frustrations, Ziva and Ireena engage in an impromptu exercise, tossing rocks in the air for Ziva to obliterate.

During the activity, Ziva broaches the topic of Ireena’s feelings for Milos. Ireena admits to having conflicting emotions, despite giving Ziva her blessing to pursue him. While she harbors feelings for Milos, she doesn’t want to stand in the way of Ziva’s pursuit.

Afterward, the trio returns home.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back at their residence, Ziva uses **Misty Step** to teleport to the roof, gazing toward Mt. Baratok. She reflects on her mission to cure Hector Villeneuve, despite both Lathander and Shar deeming the task impossible. Her faith in the gods wavers, as she resolves to explore every option herself, even against divine counsel.

The rest of the party returns home with Piddlewick, except for Milos.

Milos separates from Tian and Sally to visit Lady Wachter. Upon arriving, a guard informs him that Lady Wachter has been by her daughter Stella’s side the entire day. Just as Milos is about to leave, Lady Wachter appears at the top of the staircase and invites him to her office.

Once inside, Milos shares what he has learned about Dirk and his smuggling operation, in case Lady Wachter was unaware and wished to act on it. She laughs, admitting she already knows about Dirk’s gang and deliberately allows them to operate. Lady Wachter explains her strategy: maintaining control of the city while fostering the illusion that its citizens have freedom. By subtly influencing the gangs, she ensures that even their rebellion ultimately serves her interests.

She notes with a wry smile that she and Milos might find common ground where the rest of the **Shards of Dawn** would not, suggesting that their shared pragmatism could lead to a mutually beneficial relationship. She implies they could help one another in ways the others might not understand.

Milos steers the conversation to his true purpose: he is searching for information about a being with golden skin and tattoos of the Morninglord, the figure from his vision. Lady Wachter admits she doesn’t recall reading about such a being but offers him free access to her library for his research. She assures him he is always welcome in her house and promises to assist him in his search.

Turning to a more delicate subject, Lady Wachter hints at her interest in intelligence regarding Strahd’s inner circle. Specifically, she’s curious if there is a betrayer within Strahd’s ranks and offers Milos a boon in exchange for such information. Milos, intrigued but cautious, shares surface-level insights about the relationships between Strahd’s consorts. He makes it clear that he possesses more detailed knowledge but withholds it for now, implying a willingness to share in the future if their partnership continues.

Lady Wachter, pleased by his discretion and foresight, smiles and assures him there will be many more fruitful conversations to come.

Milos goes to check her library before he leaves and finds two books that draw his attention:

The first is an ancient book, with its spine tattered and writing barely discernible, but he manages to glean some information from it:

**\*\*Book: The life, adventures and wanderlust of Susebron Dawnfire**\*\*

“Far to the west, where the shimmering waves of the Eternity Sea kissed the alabaster cliffs of Luthendriel, an island of elven grandeur, a young warrior named Susebron Dawnfire dreamed of adventure. Though noble in blood, his heart yearned not for courtly intrigue but for the unknown lands beyond the ocean. With the blessings of his kin, he sailed eastward to the fabled realm of Eltheris, where his name would soon be etched in legend and lament. 

Susebron found his calling among a band of heroes known as the Silver Pact—six stalwart souls who stood against the terrors that plagued the land. Together, they carved their legend in blood and steel, their greatest triumph coming when they slew the dread wyrm Verathrax, whose crimson scales had darkened the skies of the Duskvale. The people rejoiced, and the Silver Pact found themselves hailed as saviors.

Among them was Gideon of Waterdeep, a cunning warrior and Susebron's closest friend. That night, in the warm glow of the Swan’s Refuge Inn, they toasted their victory with tankards raised high, unaware that their triumph would soon turn to despair. For as the bells of midnight tolled, a terrible darkness descended upon the town of Merrisport. A legion of the unliving came forth like a shadow tide—vampires, their eyes glowing with cold hunger.

Two of Susebron's companions fell before they even understood the horror that gripped the town. But worse was to come. Alinora, the fire-hearted warrior whose laughter had once filled their halls, rose before dawn’s light, her once-bright eyes now empty wells of hunger. It was Susebron himself who had to drive his sword through her heart, weeping as she crumbled into dust. The last of their strength broken, the survivors fled, only to be met with suspicion and fear. The people of Merrisport, desperate to rid themselves of the curse that had fallen upon them, exiled the remaining three heroes, sending them into the wilderness with the weight of loss upon their shoulders.

In the next town, the Silver Pact dissolved, each taking their own path into sorrow. Susebron, bereft of home and purpose, walked the long road alone.

Years passed in wandering grief, until fate turned its cruel gaze upon him once more. It was in the ruins of an ancient temple that Susebron found his old friend, Gideon of Waterdeep, whom he had thought long dead. But Gideon was not as he had been. His face was unchanged by time, his voice smooth as silk yet hollow in depth. He spoke of miracles, of salvation granted by the merciful god Ilmaris. But it was a lie.

Gideon had been taken by the vampire lord Cassiar, and now, he was no longer mortal. Susebron fought, but it was in vain. Bound in chains of silver and dragged before the dark throne of Cassiar, he was given a cruel gift—eternal life in undeath. As fangs sank into his flesh, the world faded to shadow, and Susebron Dawnfire was no more.

A century passed in servitude. For a hundred years, he obeyed his master’s will, feeding upon the living, his soul screaming within a body that was no longer his own. Until one fateful night, he shattered his chains. With fire and vengeance, he slew Cassiar and fled into the night, free—but forever cursed.

\[Rest of pages are too broken to read\]

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second book is an old book written in the style of van Richten’s guides, but this one is about the Vistani: their way of life, their customs and traditions

Milos bowwors the two books, bids Lady Wachter good night and returns to the **Shards of Dawn**'s residence, reuniting with the rest of the party.

The party makes its way to a small clearing near Lake Zarovich with the intent of reading from the *Tome of Strahd*. They set up rudimentary traps and alarms to warn them of any creatures Strahd might send to interrupt their reading.

Sally and Tian decide to stay back and keep watch, while Ireena, Milos, and Ziva gather to read the Tome. As they begin, Strahd’s voice emerges from the mists rolling into the clearing:

*"Back when I was 19... I had a glimpse of love once. Fleeting as it was. It is time I tell that story."*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scene shifts, pulling the party into the vision of a bustling war camp. Strahd, at only 19, is already a formidable general—commanding respect, fear, and awe from his soldiers.

The party learns that the army is marching on Kallet, and Turell’s fall seems inevitable. As they observe, Strahd steps out of his war tent. The camp falls silent at his presence, every soldier watching him with reverence. He immediately joins his commanders, strategizing over maps.

In the midst of his focus, his eyes catch a flash of red hair—a woman laughing as she sells bread to the soldiers. Though she bears a resemblance to Ireena and Tatyana, it is clear she is a different person. Her name drifts through the air: Marina.

Strahd’s gaze lingers on her, and while the soldiers around her grow tense under his attention, Marina remains unfazed. Boldly, she approaches him, teasing him as though he were any other man. Strahd, momentarily stunned, gathers his composure and challenges her tone.

He asks her who she is to so freely judge a general. Marina replies with confidence that she is just a villager who bakes the bread that keeps his army’s bellies full.

Her lack of fear and irreverence amuse Strahd, though a flicker of anger crosses his face. For the first time, someone sees him not as a general or a noble but simply as a man.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scene shifts to a starry sky. Ziva points out the constellations to Milos, showing him what stars really look like. When a shooting star streaks across the heavens, Milos panics as Ziva casually remarks that some stars occasionally fall from the sky. Nearby, the party notices Strahd sitting alone, sharpening his sword in quiet contemplation. Marina approaches him, carrying a small bundle in her arms. She sits beside him and reveals she has brought him stew. Her demeanor is calm and unafraid; she sees him not as a noble or a general, but as a young man burdened by his station.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scene shifts again, this time to a lively celebration. Music and laughter fill the air as soldiers and villagers mingle. Ziva and Milos join the dancing, hoping to gather more information. They learn that Strahd’s army recently defeated Elias Turell in battle and forced his retreat. The conflict stems from the Turell family's refusal to pay fealty to King Barov, prompting the king to send his son to crush their resistance and make them submit.

Ziva spots Marina seated nearby and joins her, striking up a conversation to learn more about her. Marina explains that she lives ten miles away and harbors no strong opinions on the conflict. She views the war as a petty squabble between nobles, caring only for its swift resolution with minimal bloodshed.

When Ziva asks her thoughts on Strahd, Marina describes him as intelligent but distant, a man who has built walls to keep others at bay. Ziva speculates that he must be lonely behind those walls, and something lights up in Marina’s eyes. Without hesitation, she rises and approaches Strahd, who stands at the edge of the festivities, watching the celebration in silence.

Marina boldly asks Strahd to dance. At first, he refuses, but she persists, pulling him into the circle of dancers with a mix of determination and charm. A rare smile graces his face as he reluctantly follows her lead. Meanwhile, Milos approaches the musicians and requests a classical Barovian tune to accompany the moment.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scene shifts again, this time overlooking a tranquil meadow. Strahd and Marina sit together, speaking quietly. Strahd reveals the weight of the world rests on his shoulders, his duties as a general and a son consuming him. Marina urges him to walk away from it all—his pain, his obligations—but he rebuffs her, insisting he cannot live as a farmer or merchant. The demands of this world require more from him.

Marina counters that she seeks no riches or titles, only the simple contentment of being with him. Her words momentarily pierce his defenses, and Strahd softens. Turning to her, he declares that a man’s worth is defined by the legacy he leaves behind.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scene reforms within Strahd’s war tent. A messenger arrives, delivering a curt missive from King Barov: *“Strahd, my patience grows thin. Focus, boy. Crush Elias. Burn Kallet to the ground. Do not allow sentiment to cloud your judgment.”*

Strahd crumples the letter in his hand, frustration evident. Someone has informed the king of his growing affection for Marina. Anguish and anger flash across his face as he wonders aloud if even a shred of happiness is too much to ask for.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scene shifts again to a warm afternoon before the fortified gates of Kallet. The city looms in the distance, defiant and proud. Inside Strahd’s war tent, Marina strides in with purpose. The moment she sees him, they embrace and kiss, their relationship clearly deepened despite King Barov’s warnings.

As Strahd and Marina speak, Ziva and Milos examine a map of the region, deducing that the party now stands somewhere in the northwest of the Sword Coast. Marina expresses concern over the war’s toll. Strahd’s army is better supplied, larger, and more rested than their enemies. Morale is at its peak after successfully forcing the Turell forces to retreat within Kallet’s walls. Still, Marina questions how many lives must be sacrificed to satisfy Strahd’s pursuit of victory.

Strahd, weary and resigned, insists he takes no pleasure in the bloodshed but sees no other path. Elias Turell, he explains, will order his men to fight to the last rather than surrender. Marina presses him, urging him to offer terms of surrender and end the conflict without further bloodshed.

Strahd initially scoffs, reminding her that King Barov has explicitly forbidden peace with the Turells. The king’s orders demand that Kallet be made an example. But Marina persists, and her unyielding plea strikes a chord. Reluctantly, Strahd agrees to offer Elias Turell terms of surrender—though he does so only for her sake.

As this conversation unfolds, Milos notices a pile of letters from King Barov scattered across the tent. Each letter berates Strahd for his distraction and accuses him of losing focus due to his affection for Marina. Seizing the opportunity, Milos discreetly gathers a fistful of the letters and slips them into his Bag of Holding.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scene shifts to a white tent outside of Kallet, where negotiations are underway. Elias Turell, a young and inexperienced-looking man, stands at the center. Strahd presents his terms: Elias’ immediate surrender in exchange for sparing his people and the city. Elias scoffs at the offer but attempts to negotiate further. When Strahd diplomatically declines Elias’ terms, Elias becomes angry and reminds Strahd that King Barov murdered his family when he was four years old. Strahd does not respond to the accusation, instead reiterating his terms for surrender. Elias reluctantly accepts, agreeing to the terms for no more bloodshed.

As Strahd prepares to sign the treaty, the party notices archers hidden in the trees nearby, ready to strike. The archers pull back their bows and release a volley of arrows. Strahd is hit by three. Elias picks up a hidden bow and laughs, mocking Strahd’s mercy. Having lost everything to Barov, Elias now seeks vengeance.

The party intervenes, quickly pulling Strahd out of the area before Elias can carry out his threat.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scene reforms in Strahd’s war tent. Strahd is attended to by physicians, cleaning and bandaging his wounds. He is furious and orders his commanders to spread the word: at dawn, they march on Kallet. Every man, woman, and child is to be slaughtered. The city will be sacked and burned. Strahd intends to make an example of Kallet and of Elias Turell.

Later that night, Marina enters the tent, her skin pale and eyes bloodshot. After confirming Strahd’s injuries aren’t severe, she begs him to revoke his order to burn Kallet. She knows that he is acting out of anger toward Elias Turell She pleads with him to be his own man and not to become Barov’s sword. Strahd, though generally honorable in warfare, insists that he cannot show mercy. If he does, Barov will see him as weak and strip him of everything.

Marina’s pleas continue, but Strahd coldly refuses, stating that the order stands: at dawn, Kallet burns. She leaves the tent in tears.

The next morning, a new letter arrives from King Barov: *"Do not disappoint me. You are a blade, so cut through them all."* Seeing the letter, Strahd orders for Marina to be summoned, but she is nowhere to be found. She has seemingly left the camp. Enraged, Strahd prepares for battle.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scene shifts once again, this time to the middle of a burning Kallet, now littered with fresh corpses. The attack has been swift and merciless, and every person inside the city has been slaughtered. Strahd leads his army through the streets, the devastation all around them.

The scene shifts again, now inside the castle of Kallet, the seat of House Turell. Like the rest of the city, it is burning. Strahd and Elias engage in their final duel amidst the charred remains of the castle. Elias, badly wounded, condemns Strahd for slaughtering his people. Strahd responds, reminding Elias that he brought this upon himself when he attacked during the negotiations.

Strahd, known as an efficient but honorable general, has never harmed civilians or sacked cities. Elias had hoped that Strahd would show mercy once his army surrendered. Elias, seeing all hope lost, mentions a messenger from the night who had warned them of Strahd’s plans. He had dismissed her warning, not believing Strahd would go that far, but had detained her so she could not return to inform Strahd of the city’s defenses.

Strahd realizes with horror that the messenger was Marina. She had come to warn the people, giving them the chance to flee. As Elias dies, he laughs in Strahd’s face, claiming that if Strahd had not been so ruthless, Marina would still be alive.

Strahd quickly finishes Elias off and ventures deeper into the burning castle. He finds Marina’s charred body, her once-beautiful red hair now reduced to ashes. Strahd, filled with dread, realizes that Elias’ final words were true: in his attempt to destroy Elias, he had inadvertently killed the woman he loved.

As the mists roll in, the scene dissolves.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the lake, Tian and Sally keep watch over the rest of the party, who remain immersed in the unsettling vision. An eerie sensation creeps over them, a prickling awareness that they are being watched. Sally hears faint, inexplicable sounds that seem out of place. Driven by instinct, she climbs a nearby tree to gain a better vantage point, but her sharp eyes detect no sign of any intruder.

When the vision releases its hold on the rest of the party, Tian and Sally share their unsettling experience, describing the strange sensations and sounds. As they recount what happened, Arabelle’s keen gaze catches something unusual. She begins positioning herself carefully, examining the strange patterns and formations scattered around the clearing. Twisted twigs and oddly stacked rocks, previously dismissed or overlooked by the party, now hold her full attention.

When the others question her actions, Arabelle explains. These formations, known as "*trallacks*," are markers left by the Vistani. Though they appear random, their arrangement carries meaning—hidden words encoded in a dialect of the Vistani tongue (“*Paterna*”). Individually, the symbols are meaningless, and even together they require knowledge of the dialect to decipher. Arabelle reveals that Arrigal once taught her the basics of reading *trallacks*, though her proficiency is limited.

Milos, intrigued, steps forward with the book he recovered from Wachter’s library—a tome on Vistani culture. Together, he and Arabelle piece together the cryptic message left by Strahd’s loyal Vistani:

*"This will be the last time. Time comes, death follows."*

A grim weight settles over the party as they digest the warning. Agreeing that lingering in the woods is unwise, the group makes its way back toward the house.

Along the journey, the conversation turns to Blinski and his safety. The Village of Barovia might offer him sanctuary, far from the dangers of Vallaki, but convincing him to abandon the life he has built there would be no small task. Ireena, walking alongside the group, reflects on Lady Wachter’s earlier remarks about opening trade with the Village. She begins considering how this potential connection might be leveraged to their advantage in the days ahead.

As the party approaches the house of the Shards of Dawn, the boisterous voice of Blinski carries through the night, recounting, yet again, the harrowing tale of the assault on his shop. This time, however, his embellishments paint him as the brave hero of the ordeal. Inside, the scene is both unexpected and endearing: Blinski is deep in conversation with a plump, older woman with rosy cheeks and a warm, kind smile. His rapt attention to her words is so complete that he fails to notice the party’s arrival.

When the party makes their presence known, both Blinski and the woman startle slightly but recover quickly. Blinski introduces his companion as Brumi, a friend of his. Brumi, in turn, introduces herself with an air of cheer, adding with a mischievous smile that if her late husband knew she had come to this house, he would turn in his grave. Despite the dark rumors surrounding the Shards of Dawn, Brumi says she doesn’t believe the gossip spreading through Vallaki. Instead, she has come seeking help.

Brumi explains her concern for her two nieces who live west of Vallaki, along with Ginny’s husband, Niels. Recent reports from a traveler arriving from the west have brought troubling news: people have been disappearing in the woods near their home. Her attempts to reach them by letter have gone unanswered, save for a vague and unsatisfying reply from Niels. Brumi, visibly worried, asks the party to check on Ginny and her sister to ensure their safety.

The party agrees, and Ziva reassures Brumi by explaining that she will send a telepathic message using her Sending spell once they arrive, to prevent alarm. Brumi, overwhelmed with gratitude, tries to offer payment, but it is clear she is not a wealthy woman. Instead, an agreement is made: Brumi will clean and maintain the house while the Shards of Dawn are away.

During the conversation, Brumi reveals that she is a skilled accountant, managing the ledgers of nearly all the wealthy families in Vallaki. She also shares that she is the mother of Rose, whom the party previously encountered alongside her husband, Gilli, at The Beast’s Rose, a clothing shop in Vallaki.

As Ziva subtly attempts to bring Blinski and Brumi closer, remarking on Blinski’s gentlemanly nature and his loneliness, chaos brews in the background. Piddlewick and Piccolo, the mischievous construct and monkey, wreak havoc on the recently restored furniture that Milos painstakingly repaired. Milos’s patience frays with every scratch and splinter, and he mutters dark threats of dismemberment toward both the construct and the monkey.

When the topic shifts to Blinski’s safety, the party asks if he would consider relocating to the Village of Barovia for protection. Blinski firmly refuses, insisting that his life, work, and shop are all rooted in Vallaki. The conversation then turns to a lead uncovered earlier by Ziva and Arabelle during their undercover excursion in the Stockyard. Ziva reminds the party that Blinski had been building something for them, which was subsequently stolen. This new lead might finally help locate the missing item.

The party agrees to investigate the slums, leaving Ireena and Arabelle behind to paint Arabelle’s room. As they prepare, Tian takes to the skies, seeking an aerial view of Vallaki, while Sally shifts into a Giant Bat, reasoning that the cover of night will obscure her monstrous form as she glides through the darkened city. Ziva dons her Vistani outfit and, with Milos by her side, begins the trek toward the slums, where Moxie had instructed her to seek out someone named Lucas.

As the party arrives at the slums, the atmosphere shifts dramatically. The signs of extreme poverty are everywhere—shanty tents, gaunt faces, and the pervasive stench of despair. Milos is immediately approached by a beggar pleading for coin. When Milos rebuffs him, the beggar deftly pickpockets all of Milos’s gold and vanishes into the crowd.

Nearby, Ziva notices another beggar whose feigned illness is far too exaggerated to be convincing. Sensing an opportunity, she offers him a few coins in exchange for directions. The beggar obliges, pointing them toward a cluster of tents deeper within the slums. Following the directions, Ziva and Milos make their way through the maze of ramshackle dwellings, only to be intercepted by a burly man who blocks their path and demands payment for passage.

When Ziva calmly states that they are here to meet Lucas and there is no need for aggression, the thug’s demeanor turns more hostile. He escalates the situation, threatening to kill Milos unless he abandons Ziva with him and leaves. Milos, his patience already worn thin, begins to grip the hilt of his sword, ready to act. Before he can draw it, a voice cuts through the tension.

From one of the nearby tents, a rough-looking man in a tattered cape emerges, claiming to be Lucas. Ziva explains that Moxie sent her and that she wishes to trade. Lucas, unimpressed, sneers at her and Milos, declaring that the only trade he’s interested in is for Milos’s weapons. As more thugs begin to emerge from the surrounding tents, Lucas grows bolder. With the clear advantage in numbers, he amends his terms: he will let Ziva and Milos walk away in exchange for surrendering their weapons.

Anger flashes across Milos’s face as he unsheathes his sword, the blade gleaming in the faint light. He asks Lucas to confirm that this is the weapon he desires before swiftly splitting the man in two with a decisive strike. Chaos erupts as the fight begins.

From above, Tian and Sally swoop down to join the fray. Tian dives with precision, while Sally, still in her giant bat form, cuts a monstrous figure against the night sky. Despite their numerical advantage, the bandits stand no chance against the combined might of the vampire, the winged horror, and the agile monk.

Milos fights with unrelenting ferocity, using not just his sword but his vampiric nature to rip out throats with his teeth. He takes particular satisfaction in killing the thug who had personally threatened him. Meanwhile, Ziva focuses on the task at hand, rummaging through the pockets of fallen bandits and searching their tents for the stolen tool Blinski had crafted. After a thorough search, she uncovers it hidden in a false-bottomed barrel.

As the dust settles, with most of the thugs dead and the remainder fleeing in terror, Milos, his bloodlust temporarily sated, declares the experience better than sex. Ziva takes mild offense at the comment, while Tian muses aloud whether the party’s actions might have been excessive.

Unperturbed, Sally begins hauling the mangled bodies, one by one, out of the city. She dumps them unceremoniously in the forest, cleaning up the evidence of their violent encounter. However, as she finishes, Sally notices Moxie standing nearby, horror etched across her face as she takes in the carnage.

Without hesitation, Sally scoops up the terrified Moxie and flies her back to the group. The act only deepens Moxie’s trauma, the sight of a monstrous bat carrying her through the air proving too much for her already frayed nerves. Despite Ziva’s attempts to console her, Moxie remains inconsolable. Left with no other option, the party allows her to leave.

With the stolen tool now in their possession, the party returns to their home, leaving behind the blood-soaked slums and the echoes of their actions.

On the way back to the house, the guards stationed in the streets avert their gaze, pretending not to notice the blood-soaked Milos as he strides past. Their silence is a testament to the fear or indifference that has taken root in Vallaki.

Upon arriving home, the party presents Blinski with the stolen tool he crafted. His face lights up with joy as he takes the device in hand, eagerly inspecting its condition. He begins recalibrating it with precision, his hands moving deftly over the intricate mechanisms. Blinski explains that the tool was designed with Piddlewick’s unique specifications in mind, but it lacks the arcane power needed to function properly. Unlike Piddlewick, who possesses a rare and magically infused gem for a heart, Blinski was unable to replicate the enchantments necessary to complete the device.

Ziva steps forward and produces her Lapis Lazuli, offering it as a potential power source. Milos and Sally focus their combined magic on the gem, channeling energy into the stone. Their efforts succeed, imbuing the gem with a faint magical glow. However, Ziva quickly deduces that the magic within the gem is not permanent. She observes that the rate of decay is tied to the gem’s clarity—the clearer the stone, the slower the magical energy fades. The magically infused gem, now functioning as a makeshift battery, is carefully inserted into the tool.

The device hums to life with a series of mechanical whirs and clicks, floating in midair and emitting strange, otherworldly sounds. Blinski makes a few final adjustments, explaining its versatile functions. The tool can act as a Mage Hand to lift and transport objects, transform into a key capable of unlocking doors, and perform various other useful tasks.

The party expresses their gratitude to Blinski for his work, taking the now-operational tool with them. With the day’s tasks complete and the tool in hand, the party begins preparing to rest, letting the tension of their latest ordeal gradually fade into the dim, haunted air of Vallaki.

Milos steps into Ireena’s room, finding her seated at a modest desk, pen in hand, writing in her journal. The soft scratch of ink on paper fills the quiet space as she glances up at him. Milos approaches and produces the book he recently discovered, one that recounts the tales of Susebron Dawnfire. He places it before her, asking for her thoughts.

Ireena studies the book for a moment before conceding that she believes it to be nothing more than fiction. Despite the conversation, an air of awkwardness lingers between them, the shadow of Milos’ earlier entanglement with Ziva casting an unspoken tension. Neither acknowledges it, choosing instead to focus on the discussion at hand.

Eventually, Ireena shifts the topic, asking Milos what he thinks of Brumi. Milos responds candidly, expressing suspicion. He finds Brumi’s cheerful demeanor unsettling, especially in a land as grim and oppressive as Barovia. Ireena agrees, elaborating on Brumi’s tragic past. She recounts how Brumi has buried parents, husbands, and even three children. By all accounts, she should be steeped in sorrow, yet she arrived at their doorstep smiling, brimming with warmth, and concerned for her nieces.

Milos speculates that perhaps Brumi’s optimism stems from ignorance, wondering if she might simply be foolish. Ireena dismisses the notion, pointing out that despite living in squalor, Brumi is a skilled accountant, handling ledgers for many of Vallaki’s wealthiest families. She is far from unintelligent. Ireena muses aloud, questioning whether happiness can be learned and whether the pervasive sadness afflicting Barovians is a kind of sickness—an inescapable curse tied to the land itself.

Milos considers her words and agrees. He reflects on what Sally, Tian, and Ziva have shared about the world beyond Barovia—a world bursting with joy, color, and vibrancy that the people of this land could scarcely imagine. Perhaps cultivating a positive outlook, however difficult, is a way to make survival here more bearable. He confides in Ireena, admitting he is trying to change. Milos speaks of his efforts to temper his violent impulses, revealing that he has even begun praying. He notes that he has seen a change in Ireena as well—her tears, once frequent, have grown less so.

Ireena acknowledges his observation, admitting she is working to find inner strength. Watching the others persevere has inspired her to push forward and face the darkness with resilience. The conversation draws to a close as Milos leans down, pressing a kiss to her forehead. He quietly leaves the room, retreating to his own quarters.

In her room, Sally lies on her bedroll, her thoughts heavy as they drift toward the Ladies Three and the cryptic significance of their pleas for help. The weight of their words lingers in her mind, gnawing at her as she tries to piece together their meaning and what it might demand of her.

Meanwhile, Tian perches on the rooftop, the cool night air brushing against his wings. He closes his eyes and offers a quiet prayer to Selûne, seeking solace under her light. His thoughts wander to the woman he left behind when he was drawn into this cursed land. Memories of her resurface, vivid and bittersweet, and he recalls how she often wove the word “shards” into their conversations. The connection stirs something in him, a faint flicker of clarity amidst the haze of memory.

Milos returns to his room and before succumbing to sleep, Milos kneels in his room, bowing his head in reverence. He prays to Lathander, the words spilling from his lips both an offering and a plea for guidance. In the quiet solitude of his room, he seeks strength to continue the path he has chosen and to resist the darkness that claws at his soul.

Ziva tosses and turns through a restless night, her mind refusing to grant her the peace of sleep. She drifts in and out of consciousness, her body weary but her thoughts relentless. By the time dawn approaches, she stirs fully awake, the exhaustion still clinging to her like a shroud.

Rising at the break of dawn, well before the others, Ziva methodically dons her armor and clothing. She fixes her hair and makeup, the motions practiced and precise, masking the fatigue etched on her face. Her expression hardens with resolve as she steps out of her room and makes her way downstairs to Sally’s.

Standing before Sally’s door, Ziva raps gently but firmly, the sound barely louder than a whisper. The knock stirs Sally from her slumber, and as the door creaks open, Ziva stands there, her grave expression casting a shadow over the morning light. Without hesitation, she meets Sally’s gaze and asks for her help.

At the break of dawn, Ziva stands outside Sally’s door, rapping gently but insistently. It is five in the morning, and Sally, barely conscious, blinks blearily at her. When Ziva asks for her help, Sally nods sluggishly, mumbling an agreement before stumbling back into her room under the pretense of getting dressed. Instead, she collapses onto her bed and immediately drifts back to sleep.

Unwilling to be deterred, Ziva slips inside, gathers Sally’s clothes, and lays them neatly on the bed before nudging her awake once more. Sally, still trapped in the haze of sleep, barely registers the clothes before numbly pulling them on, agreeing to everything Ziva says without fully processing it.

By the time they reach the kitchen, Ziva has prepared Vistani energy tea and wolf jerky, a quick meal to fortify them for the journey ahead. Sally, still half-stumbling, moves about clumsily, making enough noise to rouse Tian from his sleep.

Moments later, Tian appears in the kitchen doorway, rubbing the sleep from his eyes just as the two women are preparing to leave. Ziva tells him they are going on a bonding trip, hoping the explanation will dissuade him from joining. The plan works—Tian, delighted by the idea, beams and wishes them well on their journey.

Before departing, Ziva leaves a brief note on the table for the rest of the party, repeating the same story she told Tian. With a final farewell, she steps out into the cool morning air, leading a still half-asleep Sally away from the house. Behind them, Tian surveys the disarray in the kitchen and sighs before setting to work, tidying up the mess that is the kitchen.

The town is still draped in the quiet hush of early morning as Ziva and Sally make their way toward Vallaki’s northern exit. As the fresh air slowly shakes off the last remnants of sleep, Sally begins to wake, her mind finally catching up with her body. It is only then that Ziva explains the true purpose of their trip.

With Vallaki soon to be behind them, there is unfinished business that Ziva cannot ignore. She needs to reach the top of Mount Baratok, where Villeneuve lingers, his mind unraveling in the grip of madness. If he is still alive, she has prepared a way to calm him, to make him talk. If he is already dead, she has made provisions to speak with him beyond the grave.

Now more alert, Sally furrows her brow, her earlier compliance shifting into hesitation. The last time they encountered Villeneuve, he proved powerful—dangerous. She questions whether the risk is truly worth it.

Ziva does not waver. Without hesitation, she assures Sally that this is important to her, and for that reason alone, it is worth the danger.

Sally exhales, resigned. With a nod, she shifts into the form of a giant eagle, her wings stretching wide in the early light. Ziva climbs onto her back without hesitation. With a powerful beat of her wings, Sally launches them into the sky, and together they soar toward the looming peak of Mount Baratok.

The morning air is sharp and biting. Without a saddle, Ziva must stay vigilant, gripping tightly to Sally’s back as they cut through the sky.

Sally soars effortlessly over the lake, reveling in the wind rushing through her feathers and the cold water brushing against her talons. The freedom of flight is exhilarating—until movement in the depths catches her eye. A massive, tentacled arm surges upward, reaching for her from beneath the lake’s dark surface. Instinct kicks in, and she banks hard, climbing swiftly to escape the unseen threat below.

Higher and higher she ascends, pushing toward the jagged, snow-covered peaks of Mount Baratok. The cold grows more intense, and Ziva’s fingers, stiff and numb from the frigid air, struggle to maintain their hold. Their path leads them toward the site where the Shards of Dawn last encountered Villeneuve.

As they approach, both scan the landscape below, searching for any sign of him. Villeneuve remains unseen, but their vigilance pays off—scattered across the mountain’s craggy slopes, glimmering traces of his magic lay in wait. A heartbeat later, the first trap activates, unleashing a searing bolt of lightning into the sky.

Sally veers sharply, weaving through the sudden barrage of energy, managing to deftly maneuver between the multiple lightning bolts that shoot at them. When they believe they have successfully dodged all of the traps, another one fires and the sheer speed of Sally’s evasive maneuvers makes Ziva’s grip tenuous. Her fingers, nearly frozen, fail her—she slips.

The wind roars past as Ziva plummets toward the jagged rocks below. Reacting instantly, she throws out her hands, igniting a burst of flame. The force of **Burning Hands** alters her descent just enough to steer her away from the sharpest outcroppings, angling toward a patch of deep snow instead.

Sally, already shifting her course, lands on a nearby peak, wings folding as she drops her eagle form. With a swift incantation, she casts **Entangle**—vines burst forth from the icy stone, reaching for Ziva as she falls. The twisting greenery catches her midair, snapping taut as she swings precariously against the mountainside.

Barely a moment passes before another pair of traps ignite, launching fresh arcs of lightning toward them. Ziva, breathless but quick to react, shouts a warning through **Message**, alerting Sally to the attack behind her. Without hesitation, she begins swinging along the vines, using another burst of **Burning Hands** to propel herself just in time to avoid the strike.

Sally dives headfirst from the cliff, transforming midair back into her eagle form. The second bolt of lightning streaks past her, missing by inches. Below, she positions herself beneath Ziva, timing her approach perfectly. Then, with a thought, she releases the **Entangle** spell. The vines instantly wither, their magic gone, and Ziva drops—landing squarely on Sally’s back.

With no time to waste, Sally speeds toward a nearby clearing. Below, a lone figure waits: Villeneuve stands ready, his posture rigid with anticipation. The magical traps have already given away their approach, and now, there is no turning back.

Meanwhile, back at the Shards of Dawn residence, Tian busies himself in the kitchen, cleaning up the mess left behind and preparing breakfast. The scent of cooking drifts through the house as Milos and Ireena make their way downstairs, drawn by the activity.

On the table, they find Ziva’s letter—an explanation for her and Sally’s sudden departure. A *fun little bonding trip* to improve their relationship. Milos and Ireena exchange a knowing look, each voicing aloud their hope that the journey doesn’t end with the two at each other’s throats.

Milos, uninterested in Tian’s prepared meal, fixes something for himself before announcing his plans to head into town. With little explanation, he departs, leaving Tian and Ireena alone in the quiet house.

Ireena, for her part, relishes the rare opportunity to have a meal prepared for her. In her childhood, the responsibility of cooking often fell on her shoulders, despite her admitted lack of talent. As Tian sets about making a hearty stew, he casually offers to teach her, but she waves the suggestion away. For once, she intends to enjoy a meal without the burden of responsibility.

Milos makes his way to the once-holy ground of the Morninglord’s church that now serves a more somber purpose—a makeshift hospital for Vallaki’s sick and wounded. Milos steps inside, the air thick with the scent of herbs, sweat, and lingering despair.

With quiet confidence, he announces that he has been sent by the Morninglord, then moves among the suffering, placing his hands upon them. Divine energy hums at his fingertips as he calls upon his **Lay on Hands**, channeling healing light into weary bodies. For some, the change is immediate—fevered foreheads cool, ragged breathing eases. Murmurs of gratitude ripple through the room as the faithful whisper prayers of thanks.

Yet, not all receive his touch. Milos pauses at certain beds, gazing down at the afflicted as if weighing something unseen. After a moment’s hesitation, he moves on, leaving some to linger in their suffering.

The nurse on duty grows increasingly agitated, insisting that he leave, that this place is for care, not whatever grand gesture he is making. Milos counters smoothly—he *is* healing people, in a place of healing. Surely, there’s nothing wrong with that?

Frustrated, the nurse summons the guards, but when they arrive and see Milos at work, they hesitate. Healing isn’t a crime. With awkward shrugs and murmured excuses, they refuse to intervene, leaving the nurse to fume in exasperation.

As Milos steps away, the room hums with whispered prayers and quiet revelations. The grateful continue to offer thanks, while those left untouched wrestle with their faith, wondering why the Morninglord has not deemed them worthy.

His task complete, Milos leaves the church behind and returns to the Shards of Dawn residence. With time to spare, he settles into a chair, pulling out his knitting needles and begins crafting a new pair of knickers. 

Back on top of Mt. Baratok, a fight erupts between Ziva, Sally and Villeneuve. Ziva begins casting **Geas**, aiming to magically compel Villeneuve into answering questions peacefully. The spell requires a full minute to complete, so she calls on Sally to keep him distracted.

Sally drops her eagle form and prepares for battle. Villeneuve, his shattered mind twisting reality around him, unleashes his magic in violent bursts, injuring everything nearby. Sally repeatedly tries to restrain him with **Hold Person**, hoping to stop his most devastating spells, while Ziva concentrates on finishing her incantation.

Villeneuve, convinced he is under attack to be dragged back into Strahd’s grasp, fights with desperate fury. His uncontrolled magic surges wildly, striking both Ziva and Sally with overwhelming force. A powerful shockwave knocks Ziva back, breaking her focus. The **Geas** spell fizzles out before it can take hold.

Realizing peaceful resolution is no longer an option, Ziva unleashes her strongest spells, but Villeneuve shrugs off the attacks with ease, barely affected. His relentless onslaught pushes both of them to the brink. Sally continues trying to control the battlefield, struggling to pin him down, while Ziva hurls **Fireballs** at him, but he evades or resists each attempt.

As the battle drags on, Sally suffers severe wounds. Seeing her ally faltering, Ziva casts **Aura of Vitality**, channeling healing energy into Sally. The reprieve is brief—Villeneuve retaliates with a crackling **Lightning Bolt**, striking them both and breaking Ziva’s concentration on the spell.

With her strength fading, Sally summons a final burst of power, casting **Thunderwave** and sending Villeneuve staggering back, barely clinging to consciousness. Sensing his end, Villeneuve musters the last of his strength and fires two more bolts of lightning directly at Ziva.

Ziva sees the deadly magic coming and realizes she can’t move in time. Before she can react, Sally throws herself in front of the attack, taking the full force of the strike. The impact sends her crashing to the ground, unconscious and critically wounded.

Ziva rushes to help, but Villeneuve’s body, no longer able to contain his wild magic, detonates in a final surge of energy. The explosion engulfs Ziva, and the last thing she feels is searing pain before everything fades to darkness.

Sally stabilizes, her body battered and broken, but remains unconscious in the freezing, hostile environment. Alone, exposed to the elements, she is dying as well.

Ziva awakens in the familiar void between life and death, standing before Lathander, the Morninglord. He asks if it was worth it—dying like this for the answers she sought.

The thought of Sally lingers in Ziva’s mind. It wasn’t worth Sally’s life. Sally doesn’t deserve to die on that mountain just for agreeing to help.

Lathander presses further, asking what comes next. Ziva acknowledges her own death, understanding what awaits her, but pleads for Sally’s life instead.

Lathander questions whether she is truly content with dying here. She admits she would rather live, but there is no one left to bring her back. It doesn’t matter. What matters is Sally. She begs again—spare Sally.

Lathander reminds her of the delicate balance between life and death. Sally isn’t gone yet. A touch of divine intervention could save her. But what is Ziva willing to offer in return?

Without hesitation, she offers anything. Since *that* morning, she has belonged to him. Whatever he asks, she will do. Lathander challenges her claim. She has not been his entirely. Her connection to Shar remains. If she truly wishes to serve him, she must sever that tie.

He lays out his terms:

* If Lathander restores Sally’s strength, sparing her from death, and Sally succeeds in reviving Ziva, Ziva will have 30 days to sever her connection to Shar. Failure to do so will result in her death, with her soul scattered beyond reach, unable to be restored by any means.  
* Should Sally attempt to bring Ziva back and Ziva refuse the return to life, the burden of breaking Shar’s hold will fall entirely upon Sally. If she fails in this task, her fate will mirror Ziva’s—death, followed by the scattering of her soul, forever beyond salvation.

Ziva accepts and Lathander instructs her to pray. She does, desperation in every word. As she fades into nothingness, she sees both Lathander and Shar watching her soul, with Shar murmuring: “*such a pity.”*

Sally awakens, bloodied and battered, the freezing air biting at her exposed skin. She is alive, but barely. As she gathers her senses, she spots Villeneuve’s motionless body beside her. A flicker of relief starts to form—until she notices Ziva lying a short distance away.

Panic sets in. She scrambles to Ziva’s side, shaking her, calling her name. There is no response. Ziva’s face is streaked with fresh, radiant tears, but her chest remains still. She isn’t breathing.

Fear grips Sally as she repeats to herself that this isn’t happening, that this *cannot* be happening. Desperation fuels her as she rummages through Ziva’s Bag of Holding, fingers trembling as she searches for the diamond tucked safely inside.

She mutters that she wasn’t trained for this, that she doesn’t know if she can do this—but she has to try. There is no other choice. Carefully, she turns Ziva onto her back, places the diamond on her chest, and begins to cast **Revivify**.

As the spell takes form, Sally’s thoughts race. She remembers every moment—every frustration, every argument, every time Ziva was vague on purpose, every lie, and Ziva killing that person in Valaki in cold-blood. But then come the other memories. The moments of trust. How well they once worked together. How, for all her flaws, Ziva put her heart and soul into everything she did, always trying—perhaps failing, but *trying*—to do right by those around her.

The magic takes hold, a flash of light erupts, and in the infinite void, Ziva sees a hand reaching for her. Sally’s hand. Without hesitation, she grasps it, allowing Sally to pull her back.

Ziva’s eyes snap open as she takes a sharp, agonizing breath. The cold, the pain—it all slams back into her at once. Tears spill down her cheeks as the weight of her return settles over her.

Sally doesn’t hesitate. She throws herself onto Ziva, pulling her into a tight embrace, her own tears spilling freely.

Ziva begins to apologize—apologizing for everything, for the way she treated Sally, for the secrets she kept. The words come in choked sobs. Sally clings to her, and for a long time, neither of them move. They just hold on.

Eventually, Ziva gathers the strength to cast **Aura of Vitality**, mending their wounds, warding off the creeping cold.

After some time, they disentangle, the overwhelming tide of emotion settling into something quieter, steadier. The ordeal is far from over, but they are alive. Then, their eyes fall on Villeneuve’s corpse.

Sally asks if Ziva wants to perform the ritual now. Ziva rises to her feet, determination setting in. The two prepare—Ziva readying **Speak with Dead**, while Sally steels herself to gaze deep into whatever semblance of soul the spell will summon.

Ziva casts the spell. Five spectral tendrils lash out, binding Villeneuve’s corpse to her outstretched hand like a puppet on strings. Five glowing green runes ignite beside his head. The spell has taken hold.

Sally peers into Villeneuve’s soul, immediately sensing something is wrong. There is interference—an outside force tampering with it, complicating the ritual.

His soul bears a malignant growth, a dark tumor consuming it from within. It isn’t natural; it was placed there by someone else. What once might have been a boon now festers, a deal soured by an unpaid price. In exchange for power, a debt was incurred, and with that debt left unfulfilled, the tumor has begun devouring what remains of him.

Digging deeper, Sally tries to understand the nature of the corruption. A flood of sensations overwhelms her—blood, the rich texture of red and black velvet, the cloying scent of wine and death. The source becomes undeniable. This is Strahd’s work. The corruption was planted when Villeneuve was tortured, twisted into insanity.

Time is short. Sally urges Ziva to ask her questions quickly; she cannot hold this thing back for long.

Ziva wastes no time. She asks her questions:

1. **You met with Nirce mo Nakloz at the Belle de Nuit on the 1st of Kythorn, 733\. She was troubled afterward. What did you tell her to do?**

The answer comes strained, rasping—like something inside Villeneuve is fighting against the interrogation: 

*"Asked her to send… over… hand me…"*

2. **Is Nirce alive?**

Sally pushes harder, forcing the truth through the resistance:

*"No."*

3. **Who killed the girl?**

Summoning all her strength, Sally breaks through the tumor’s hold, allowing the words to spill forth freely:

*"I did. She was my target. I was paid to kill her, so I did. Her friend didn’t want to sell her out, but I found her on my own and finished the job."*

4. **Why was the girl killed?**

Again, Sally holds the corruption at bay. Villeneuve’s soul does not hesitate:

*"I was hired by a woman from this land. Old. Cryptic. Always spoke in riddles. She asked me to do it at all costs."*

5. **What happened between you and Strahd?**

Sally’s last reserves of strength force Villeneuve to continue:

*"I came back when the deed was done. She told me to hide. I tried, but he found me, broke me, asked Why? Who? I was just sent to kill the girl. She never told me. He ripped me apart. In order to stop the pain, I accepted him, but I lied, and when I broke the deal, my whole world unraveled. I didn’t want to be a tool. Just…"*

The tumor surges, consuming what remains. Sally can no longer fight it. The spell collapses as Villeneuve’s soul is wrenched away, pulled into the abyss beyond.

Looking down at his lifeless body, Ziva finally notices that Villeneuve was Vistani. A man of this land. She begins to tremble, hands clenched at her sides, fury mounting as the pieces fall into place.

The two retreat to what remains of Villeneuve’s shack, seeking shelter before their journey home.

Still shaking, Ziva’s composure breaks. Tears fall, but her voice remains steady as she finally speaks. She never invited Shar into her soul. She doesn’t know what Shar wanted or still wants from her. She didn’t even *know* it was Shar until Sally pointed it out. She promises an explanation—but not now. Not yet. She needs time.

Sally asks if she’s alright. Ziva exhales, her voice hollow. She had the perfect life in Waterdeep. Now, it’s gone. Sally understands. Once, she too had a perfect life—before Shar’s shadows swallowed her village whole. Silence lingers as they gather their strength.

Sally asks Ziva how come she’s alive. She was bleeding out in the blizzard, by all accounts she should have been dead. Ziva tells her of the interaction she had with Lathander in the void between life and death and about Lathander’s terms. She also tells Sally that before Lathander laid out his terms, she was considering stepping into the afterlife and not coming back, but when she heard that the burden of getting rid of Shar’s influence would fall on Sally, with Sally's soul on the line, she decided to come back. Ziva also asks Sally not to say anything about the dying part and Sally agrees.

After resting a bit, Sally shifts into a giant eagle once more. Ziva climbs onto her back, and together, they take flight, leaving the cursed mountain behind as they head home to Vallaki.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the Shards of Dawn residence in Vallaki, the scent of simmering stew fills the air as Tian and Ireena put the finishing touches on their meal. Milos, seated at the table, focuses on knitting with steady hands. The quiet domestic moment is shattered by the sudden crash of furniture upstairs, followed by a piercing scream—Arabelle.

Without hesitation, they abandon what they’re doing and rush toward the source of the noise. Bursting into Arabelle’s room, they find chaos. The walls are covered in frantic, repeated scrawls of a single phrase: **"THE SAME\!"** The tarokka deck, once whole, lies in ruin—each card torn cleanly in half and scattered across the floor like fallen leaves.

Arabelle stands in the center of it all, her eyes distant, lost in a trance. Ireena moves first, crossing the room and gripping the girl’s shoulders. At her touch, the spell breaks. The moment awareness returns to Arabelle’s gaze, the trance gives way to tears. She collapses into Ireena’s arms, sobbing.

As Ireena holds her, Arabelle's sobs gradually subside, though her breath still hitches with the remnants of panic. When Tian quietly asks what happened, Arabelle struggles to recall, her memory fragmented and uncertain.

The walls of her room are scrawled with the same chilling phrase: *"The Same,"* written in a chaotic array of sizes and shapes. The words spiral outward in fractal-like patterns, the jagged script growing more frantic toward the edges. Scattered across the floor are her tarokka cards, each one torn cleanly in half, split vertically down the center.

When Tian points out the writing and the destroyed cards, Arabelle's concern deepens. She has no memory of doing any of it. Moments like this are rare for her, instances where reality slips away entirely. It has only happened once before, years ago, under circumstances she refuses to speak about.

Tian quietly leaves the room, returning with a glass of water to steady her nerves. Without a word, he prepares a warm bath, the scent of lavender from an old satchel perfuming the rising steam, offering her some measure of comfort amid the disarray.

Milos returns home from the church, the weariness of the day settling into his bones. He sits at the kitchen table, picking up his knitting project, but the quiet rhythm of the needles is quickly interrupted by sharp, insistent knocking at the front door.

Opening it, he finds Claude standing at the threshold, flanked by five Vallaki guards. The tension in Claude’s face is barely concealed as he informs Milos that the burgomaster has summoned him.

With a resigned sigh, Milos sets down the half-finished knickers and steps outside, following the guards without protest.

As the group moves through the darkened streets, Claude falls into step beside Milos, his tone light but purposeful. He mentions speaking with his people, claiming to be building an army.

Milos, skeptical of such bold claims, senses an undercurrent of truth behind the bravado. Curious, he offers his help, should Claude need it.

After a brief hesitation, Claude relents, admitting the truth. His "army" consists of seven people, gathered in secret to play cards and discuss *“stratagems.”* They are neither loyalists nor rebels, simply townsfolk who want a better life for everyone.

Upon arriving at the Wachterhaus, Milos is quietly escorted through the house and into the backyard, where the rhythmic sound of wood splitting echoes through the crisp air. Following the noise, he finds Lady Wachter herself, clad in practical civilian clothing, methodically driving an axe into thick logs.

When Milos offers to assist, she waves him off, stating that the labor helps ease tension. There is a sharpness to her tone as she explains the reason for his summons—news of his actions at the hospital has reached her ears.

Milos meets her gaze without flinching, asserting that he sees no wrongdoing in what he has done. As a paladin of the Morninglord, he simply sought out the church, only to find it repurposed as a hospital. Faced with the sight of the sick and suffering, he acted on instinct, using his divine gifts to heal those in need.

To Wachter, however, his intervention appears less like altruism and more like a calculated power play against her regime. Milos concedes that he took advantage of the opportunity, but not as a move against her authority—rather, as a step toward rekindling faith in the Morninglord.

The conversation grows tense when Wachter mentions the head nurse, Emira, and her complaints about his interference. Milos counters firmly, arguing that those he healed would have died otherwise. He does not question Emira's skill, only her capacity to manage the overwhelming burden placed upon her shoulders.

Wachter falls silent for a moment, weighing his words with the same deliberate focus she applies to splitting wood. At last, she presents a proposition: she offers Milos a permanent station in Vallaki, a chance to establish the resurgence of his faith in a lasting, official capacity.

Milos, unshaken, declines the offer. While he bears no resentment toward the hospital's existence, he has more pressing matters to attend to and refuses to be bound to one place.

Her expression hardens. She remarks on his audacity, accusing him of playing a dangerous game. Unfazed, Milos responds with a sardonic edge, reminding her that all Barovians, himself included, exist in a state of cursed immortality. With nothing left to lose, he is merely testing the limits of that reality.

After a long pause, Wachter proposes a compromise. The hospital will be restored as a church, serving both as a place of healing and a center for spiritual guidance. In return, Milos is to act as its priest whenever he is in town, leading sermons for those seeking solace.

Though skeptical of his aptitude for preaching, Milos agrees, bluntly admitting that he excels more at killing than at delivering sermons.

Wachter, unexpectedly amused, accepts his answer and offers him an additional arrangement. When he next passes through Vallaki, she will have contracts ready for his *better* skills, should he wish to take them.

Before leaving, Milos inquires about Stella. Wachter’s guarded expression softens, if only slightly. Stella is recovering, slowly but surely. She has begun to eat but remains silent, the trauma still holding her voice captive.

As their conversation draws to a close, Wachter asks about the Shards of Dawn’s next destination. Milos informs her of Brumi's request—to investigate the situation to the west and check on her niece. Wachter’s intrigue is evident. She expresses her own interest in news from that region, promising that any information the party provides will be met with insights of her own.

With the terms set and the conversation concluded, Milos bids her farewell and returns home, the faint sound of the axe striking wood following him as he steps back into the streets of Vallaki.

Sally lands heavily in front of the house, her wings folding inward as she shifts from her avian form back into her human shape. Without hesitation, the two women push through the door, exhaustion weighing down their every step.

Ireena and Tian, bustling about the kitchen, freeze at the sight. The last they'd heard, Sally and Ziva had set off on what was meant to be a lighthearted bonding trip. Instead, they return bruised, beaten, and bloodied.

Ziva barely spares an explanation. She strides forward, wrapping Tian in a tight embrace, her breath warm against his ear as she whispers an urgent request for a private conversation. She warns him to stay composed when she and Sally recount their ordeal and instructs him to seek her out when the moment presents itself.

Before anything more can be said, the hurried patter of small feet echoes from the staircase. Arabelle rushes down, her wide eyes brimming with tears. She stares at Ziva for a heartbeat, disbelieving, before throwing herself into her arms. Between sobs, she murmurs a haunting confession: she *saw* Ziva die.

Ziva crouches to meet her gaze, steady and soft. She brushes the hair from Arabelle’s tear-streaked face, assuring her that she stands here now—whole, breathing, and very much alive.

Sniffling, Arabelle stammers through what little she recalls of her vision. Fragments slip away like smoke the harder she tries to grasp them. Only one phrase lingers, stark and unyielding: *"There is no way. They are the same."*

Before Ziva can press further, Milos calls from upstairs, urging her to see what Arabelle scrawled across the walls. Ziva rises but not before brushing a hand across Arabelle's cheek and making a quiet promise—to do her best to be worthy of such a remarkable little sister.

Upstairs, the room stands in chaotic disarray. The walls are plastered with the phrase *“The Same,”* scrawled in frantic, looping handwriting. The words twist into swirling patterns, fractal shapes that spiral outward like cracks in glass. Across the floor, Arabelle's tarokka deck lies shredded, each card split cleanly down the center.

Ziva stares at the kaleidoscopic patterns, her breath catching. The shapes are achingly familiar—eerily reminiscent of her own experiences with visions. When fragmented glimpses of fate reshaped themselves, they always converged into these very fractals, like shattered reflections folding into one.

Realization dawns. Arabelle must have witnessed the confluence of multiple realities, momentarily glimpsing the collapse of divergent futures into a singular, immutable truth.

The phrase *“The Same”* echoes in her mind, and her thoughts spiral into four stark possibilities:

1. The impossibility of stopping someone from dying.  
2. The impossibility of achieving the party’s ultimate goal—defeating Strahd and freeing the land.  
3. The impossibility of truly killing Strahd.  
4. Madame Eva's cryptic words: *"Two broken knots make a whole thread."* The connection between Ziva and Arabelle, fractured yet intertwined.

Lost in the labyrinth of her own mind, Ziva barely notices Arabelle reaching out until the girl's small hand slips into hers, pulling her back to the present.

Wordlessly, Ziva draws her own deck of tarokka cards from her satchel. She presses them into Arabelle’s hands, insisting that the girl needs them more than she does right now.

Arabelle hesitates, then clutches the deck to her chest, eyes shining with a fragile hope.

Together, they descend the stairs, finding Tian in the kitchen, standing proudly over a feast fit for royalty. The warmth of the hearth and the rich aroma of roasted meats and spiced vegetables momentarily push aside the weight of dark omens. For now, there is food, warmth, and the fragile comfort of surviving another day.

The kitchen hums with quiet warmth as the party gathers around the table, the rich aroma of wolf stew filling the air. Each bowl steams invitingly, and despite the weariness hanging over the group, the meal offers a rare moment of solace.

Milos, stirring his spoon thoughtfully, recounts the details of his conversation with Wachter earlier that afternoon. His voice remains steady, though his eyes flicker with the weight of unspoken thoughts. Across the table, Ziva savors every bite as though it might be her last, closing her eyes with each mouthful. Ireena, seated beside Tian, can't seem to stop praising his culinary skills, her tone light and genuine, a brief reprieve from the constant tension of survival.

In stark contrast, Sally sits silent and pale, her complexion as white as fresh parchment. She trembles, not with the shiver of cold but with something deeper, more primal. Milos notices immediately, rising without a word to drape additional blankets around her shoulders. Yet the tremors persist, untouched by warmth.

Frustration finally frays his patience. He places his spoon down with deliberate care, his gaze hardening as he demands an explanation from Ziva. But Ziva only meets his stare with a sharp shake of her head, glancing meaningfully toward Arabelle. Whatever truth lies beneath the surface, it will not be spoken in the child's presence.

Recognizing the impasse, Milos exhales slowly, pushing back from the table. He moves upstairs to Arabelle’s room, determined to restore some sense of normalcy, however fleeting. He goes upstairs and cleans her room, scrubbing the ominous fractals from the walls. With a whispered word and a flick of his hand, **Thaumaturgy** fills the space with the comforting scent of campfire smoke, rich and nostalgic.

Arabelle, following quietly behind, stops in the doorway, eyes wide with delight. She throws her arms around Milos in thanks, her earlier fears momentarily forgotten. With a beaming smile, she retreats into her room, curling up amidst the familiar, smoky warmth. The party lingers only briefly before preparing to head out once more.

After the meal, Tian steps outside, stretching his wings beneath the twilight sky. A restless need for freedom stirs within him.

Without hesitation, he launches himself into the air, powerful wingbeats propelling him upward. The cold wind lashes against his face as he climbs higher and higher, eyes locked on the pale, mist-shrouded sun hanging like a ghost in the sky.

The mist thickens around him, swirling in cold, damp tendrils that cling to his feathers. He pushes onward, determination tightening his jaw. Resistance builds, an invisible barrier pressing back against his ascent, but he refuses to yield. With a sharp tilt of his wings and a burst of speed, he twists into a complex aerial maneuver, slipping past the unseen threshold.

The sun blazes brighter now, though still obscured by the veil of mist. For one fleeting moment, it seems within reach—warmth and light breaking through the ever-present gloom of Barovia.

Then, without warning, the resistance snaps.

Tian feels the world invert as gravity reasserts itself, pulling him downward in a sickening rush. He plummets headfirst toward the earth, the gray silhouette of Vallaki rushing up to meet him. Heart pounding, he instinctively flares his wings, fighting against the accelerating fall.

The ground looms closer. Faster.

Then, in an instant of practiced control, he catches the wind beneath his wings, slowing his descent into a graceful glide. With a final, powerful beat, he lands soundlessly in front of the house, the adrenaline still thrumming through his veins.

The mist above thickens once more, concealing the sun behind its oppressive curtain. The sky returns to its familiar, muted gray, as if Tian's defiance had never pierced its veil.

Once Tian returns to the house, the party regathers, the warmth of the evening stew now replaced by an air of heavy anticipation. Ziva takes a deep breath, steadying herself before speaking. Her voice, usually measured and calm, carries an edge of vulnerability as she begins to explain where she and Sally had gone.

The journey had led them to the mountains, to Villeneuve. Ziva needed answers, the kind that had haunted her for years. She admits the truth the party has long suspected but never fully understood—her obsession with answers has always been more than mere curiosity. Each deflection, every half-truth she offered in the past, was born not from secrecy, but from something deeply personal, something she believed didn't concern the rest of the group.

But now, after placing Sally's life in danger, the line between personal burden and shared consequence has blurred. The party deserves the full story.

Ziva recounts her youth with an almost detached clarity, as though speaking of someone else. At sixteen, her parents sent her to Waterdeep, securing an apprenticeship for her with a seamstress. It was honest work, but Ziva despised it. Her hands, clumsy with thread and needle, found no satisfaction in the endless stitching. Restless and resentful, she stumbled into another path—one that felt far more suited to her natural talents: she became a courtesan.

In that world, Ziva thrived. Her charm and sharp wit earned her swift renown, and her clientele grew increasingly exclusive: wealthy merchants, ambitious politicians, nobles, and even captains of the City Guard. In that time, she became good friends with another courtesan, Nirce mo Nakloz, a dragonborn woman whose apartments shared the same floor as Ziva’s.

With newfound prosperity, Ziva enjoyed a life of comfort, but comfort bred greed. When Nirce proposed a scheme—selling secrets gleaned from clients in exchange for gold—Ziva didn’t hesitate. The risk seemed small, and the reward undeniable. Information, it turned out, paid far better than companionship.

The gold flowed easily, and Ziva's wealth grew beyond anything she'd imagined. Yet, amid the triumph, a shadow crept closer. One of Nirce’s newest handlers was Villeneuve. From the moment she heard his name, Ziva’s instincts screamed in warning, but Nirce brushed off her concerns. Villeneuve paid well, and in their world, coin often spoke louder than caution.

Then came the night everything unraveled.

Nirce asked Ziva to meet Lord Barth, one of her own regular clients. There was nothing unusual in the request, save for the tightness around Nirce's eyes, the tension she tried to mask behind a forced smile. Ziva noticed but chose to ignore it. They promised to meet at their favorite bar the following evening, and Ziva, ever pragmatic, set aside her worry and went to see Lord Barth.

The next night, Ziva waited. And waited. Nirce never arrived.

Frustration simmered into anger. It wasn’t like Nirce to stand her up, especially not without word. After an hour of waiting for her friend and nursing her irritation, Ziva gave up and left, taking the familiar route home through winding streets she’d traversed countless times before.

But that night, the streets felt different.

The prickle of unseen eyes followed her steps, though every glance over her shoulder revealed nothing but empty alleys and flickering arcane lamplights. She told herself it was paranoia, the product of a long day and sour mood.

The second time she turned to look, she was met not with shadows but cold steel.

The blade drove into her shoulder, white-hot pain stealing her breath. Instinct took over. She screamed and ran, feet pounding against the cobblestones, but she was poorly dressed for running on cobblestones. Her attacker caught up with her easily.

Desperation gave her strength, and she fought with everything she had. She screamed for help again, the sound raw and ragged, knowing she wasn’t far from the bustling main road. There was no way someone wouldn’t hear her cries, but in the end, no one came.

The struggle dragged on, every heartbeat stretching the nightmare longer. Her resistance bought her nothing but exhaustion, the fleeting hope of survival slipping through her fingers like sand.

In the end, she died there, alone in that alley.

The room falls silent as Ziva’s words fade. The truth, long buried beneath bravado and deflection, now lies bare before the party.

Ziva continues: In life, she believed in nothing. In death, she drifted into nothingness, her sense of self unraveling until she forgot who and what she once was.

She can’t know how much time passed, but the next thing she heard from the void was the murmur of chanting, a distant hum that swelled into a deafening chorus. Amidst the cacophony, a voice emerged—silken, persuasive. Shar (though Ziva didn’t know at the time who she was speaking with). The Lady of Loss promised vengeance, her words a balm for wounds Ziva no longer remembered. Fear coiled tight within her as the chanting grew sharper, more insistent. Unaware of the true nature of the voice, Ziva rejected the offer, and commanded the presence to leave her be.

Darkness folded around her once more, deeper and colder than before. Time ceased to hold meaning until another voice, warm and golden, broke through the void: *Breathe. Awaken.*

Ziva gasped and tried to open her eyes, lungs seizing on the first breath of her second life. She woke in a shallow grave within a forest clearing, dirt clinging to her skin and clothes. Above her, the sky blushed with the colors of dawn, the sunrise more radiant than any she has ever seen. In that moment, she understood who had pulled her out from the void: Lathander.

The length of her death remains uncertain, but the tattered state of her clothing suggests months—somewhere between three and six. A monk of the Morninglord found her soon after, drawn by divine providence. Under her guidance, Ziva learned to accept what had happened to her and what it meant to walk the path of a cleric of the Morninglord.

Although she accepted what had happened, she could not let it go. She believed that her murder was a consequence of her selling the secrets of important people in Waterdeep, so she could not return to her old life before finding out who it was that hired the assassin to go after her. In hindsight, she muses, abandoning the search could have spared her the dangers ahead. She could have returned to Waterdeep, and safely resumed her life.

But she did not know that at the time so she started to piece things together and investigate her own murder. The trail led her to Villeneuve, the last handler of Nirce. She chased him, but he proved to be a slippery bastard. One day, she caught up with him in a village near Daggerford. When she started to give chase, Villeneuve took off and vanished into the woods. She followed, but lost him again in the dense woods. Nightfall forced her to make camp. When dawn broke, the world around her had changed: she woke up in Barovia, all of her gear lost in the mists.

Trapped in the cursed land, Ziva continued the hunt, knowing little of Villeneuve beyond his connection to her death. When they found Villeneuve on top of that mountain, mind broken, Ziva knew she had to speak with him at all costs. 

So, this morning, she enlisted Sally’s help, and together they flew to the mountain. The plan was simple: negotiate if possible, extract answers by force if necessary. 

Peace, however, remained elusive. Villeneuve refused to surrender. The fight that followed was brutal, leaving both Ziva and Sally bloodied and bruised. He proved a match for both of them, each strike driving home the danger of their pursuit. Victory came by the narrowest of margins. In the aftermath, Ziva cast **Speak with Dead** to bring some semblance of life into his body and Sally’s soul-gazing abilities helped pry the answers from the lifeless body.

When Sally looked deep within his soul, she noticed a malignant tumor festering within what remained of Villeneuve’s soul, a corruption placed there by Strahd. But the rot is not the only horror. Under closer scrutiny, Ziva realised that Villeneuve is Vistani.

The tension in Milos is immediate, his body going rigid at the word. Ziva presses on. Villeneuve had not acted alone; he was hired to kill her at all costs. The contract, she explains, came from Madame Eva.

Milos’s fury erupts. His fist slams into the table, splintering the wood with the force of the blow. The sharp crack echoes through the room, drawing Arabelle’s curious gaze from her own room upstairs.

Ziva continues, her voice steady despite the weight of the truth. The other presence she has long felt—the pull gnawing at the edges of her soul—belongs to Shar. Only during the Vallaki uprising, when Sally confronted her about it, did the full gravity of the situation become clear.

She admits to speaking with Lathander earlier that morning, though she carefully omits to tell the party she did so because she died. The Morninglord’s warning lingers in her mind: two gods pulling at the same soul has left it frayed, unstable.

The conclusion is stark: Ziva has thirty days. If she cannot sever her connection to Shar by then, her soul will unravel entirely, scattered beyond the reach of any resurrection magic.

Milos’s anger flares as he demands to know why Lathander cannot do more than simply warn Ziva of her impending fate. Ziva tries to explain that the warning itself is an act of aid, a chance to fight back, but Milos snaps, frustration sharpening his words. Gods should wield power without limits—they should be able to do whatever they want.

The conversation circles back to the inevitable. Thirty days. That is all the time Ziva has left, and she resolves to make the most of it. Milos’s temper boils over once more, his voice edged with desperation. What she needs to do is find a way to sever the connection and survive, not waste time savoring borrowed moments.

Ziva promises to try, to fight until the end. But if she fails, she asks Milos for one final favor: to look after Arabelle.

The request lands heavily. Milos shakes his head, jaw tightening. He cannot make such a promise—not with the dangers he faces. There is no safe place for a child where his path leads.

Sally, listening quietly until now, straightens and volunteers without hesitation. If Ziva falls, Sally will ensure Arabelle is cared for. Ziva nods gratefully, but the weight of reality settles between them. There is no place for Arabelle on the path ahead. She must be returned to Luvash, away from the coming storm.

Realizing the burden she tried to place on Milos, Ziva apologizes, admitting she had spoken without thinking. Milos waves it off, weariness dulling the edge of his anger. It would not have been an issue, he mutters, if Barovia’s horrors did not loom over them all.

The conversation shifts, Milos circling back to Madame Eva. Suspicion hardens into certainty as he voices what has lingered unspoken: Eva’s machinations are responsible for more than they realized. He recounts a chilling memory from childhood—his parents, already scarred by loss, spoke of other children before him. Siblings stolen by an *old witch*, vanished without a trace.

Ziva wonders aloud if Eva is responsible for those kidnappings as well, but Milos remains unmoved. He does not wish to know if it is true or not. The past cannot be changed, and answers will not undo what has already been taken from him.

Their discussion is interrupted as Arabelle, drawn downstairs by the shattering of the table, stands bewildered at the tension in the room. Hearing them speak ill of Madame Eva—or *Granny,* as she calls her—sparks immediate defensiveness.

Ziva explains as gently as she can. The party believes Eva has committed terrible acts, sacrifices made in her crusade against Strahd. But Arabelle remains unconvinced. From her perspective, Eva has simply found a way to achieve something.

The child’s gaze sharpens as she studies Ziva. Does Ziva intend to hurt Eva?

Ziva hesitates, grasping for a lie, but the simmering anger in her eyes betrays her. Honesty, grudging and raw, follows. She does not plan to hurt Eva—*probably.* But the wound is fresh, and the fury is hard to contain.

Milos, unwilling to let the conversation spiral further, brings the focus back to the party’s survival. No more individual excursions. From now on, they move as one, and Ziva, in particular, should inform them before attempting any more reckless stunts, after all, he’s always up for killing people.

The tension lingers as the conversation fractures. Ziva and Tian slip away to speak in private, while Sally retreats to tend to her still-bleeding wounds. Milos, ever restless, leaves the house and goes back toward the church.

In Sally’s room, she struggles to dress her wounds, her movements sharp with frustration. The gash along her side is awkwardly placed, just beyond her reach. Each attempt to wrap the bandage pulls a hiss of pain from her lips.

Footsteps sound in the hallway, and then Ireena appears, drawn by the faint noise. Her gaze sweeps over Sally, softening into concern as she takes in the half-dressed wounds. Without waiting for permission, she steps forward, hands already reaching for the supplies.

Sally protests weakly, but Ireena examines the injury with practiced efficiency. The verdict is grim: the wound needs stitches. Her touch remains gentle as she threads the needle, but her voice carries quiet worry when she asks how Sally is holding up.

Sally’s usual bravado falters. She is rattled, hands trembling despite her best efforts to steady them.

When Ireena asks if an argument broke out between Sally and Ziva on the way back, Sally scoffs, though the humor falls flat. There was no one to argue with, she mutters—Ziva had been too focused, too single-minded in her mission.

Ireena nods thoughtfully, then reaches for something tucked away in her notebook. Carefully, she withdraws a pressed flower, the same bloom Sally had given her long ago when hope felt like a distant memory. Without a word, she places it in Sally’s hand and exclaims that Sally needs this more than she does right now.

Silence stretches between them, fragile yet comforting. Eventually, the conversation drifts to darker thoughts—what defines evil, and where the line truly lies. Ireena’s expression clouds as she wonders aloud whether her own recent thoughts mark her as something less than good.

The memory of Arabelle’s fit lingers in her mind, the word *"the same"* scrawled over and over again on the walls. It dredges up another echo, one spoken by Strahd himself the last time they stood in Vallaki.

Lifetime after lifetime, he had said. Countless cycles, endless attempts to claim her, each ending with the same bitter result.

The thought festers, and Ireena hesitates before voicing the conclusion gnawing at her resolve. Perhaps surrender is the answer. If she goes to him willingly—if she forsakes her happiness, her freedom—could the land itself be saved?

She speaks quietly, almost to herself. Her soul must be tied to whatever Strahd did, to the moment that shaped him into the monster he is today.

Sally, silent until now, offers a rare, soft smile. *"You don’t die for friends,"* she says quietly. *"You live for them."*

The words hit their mark. Ireena’s lips curve into a faint smile, warmth flickering behind weary eyes. Yet the weight of uncertainty remains. She confesses her struggle to find purpose, the constant battle between anger and helplessness.

Purpose may not lie in stitching wounds, but for now, it is enough. Ireena continues her work in companionable silence, the soft pull of thread through skin the only sound as the storm outside rages on.

Milos returns to the former church, now repurposed as both a place of worship and a makeshift hospital. He informs Emira of this transformation, but the nurse greets the claim with disbelief. Undeterred, Milos approaches the space where the altar once stood and kneels to pray, his thoughts raw and turbulent. He calls out to the Morninglord, questioning why Ziva has been given a thirty-day ultimatum and why a god, with all his power, cannot simply release her from this fate.

The Morninglord answers, his voice resonating through the throat of one of the injured lying nearby. He challenges Milos, asking who he is to judge a god so freely without understanding the bounds of divine will. There is a difference, Lathander warns, between seeking guidance and demanding it.

Milos, undeterred by the chastisement, insists that he simply cannot understand why the Morninglord refuses to intervene for Ziva. The Morninglord explains that Ziva is tainted—marked by a pact that binds her to forces beyond divine interference. Celestial law prevents one god from undoing the work of another. Ziva must make her own choices. Until she does, both Lathander and Shar remain bound by the same stalemate.

Desperate for a path forward, Milos asks what he can do to aid her. The answer is stark: there is nothing he can do. This is Ziva's burden alone, and all Milos can offer is faith.

Milos acknowledges that faith does not come easily to him. At first, he followed Lathander for the blessings the god might bestow upon him, but now he follows in an effort to change—to atone—and because he seeks answers about the golden-skinned man from his visions, and he believes the answers lie with the Morninglord.

Lathander affirms that the road of repentance stretches long before Milos. Faith once came easily to him, but reclaiming it will demand sacrifice and resilience. Acknowledging that he has already interfered too much in mortal affairs, the god withdraws, bound by the very rules that restrain divine interference. The communion ends abruptly, and Milos finds himself once more in the cold, flickering candlelight of the church.

All around him, the sick and wounded—those he had not yet healed—watch him with newfound hope. One, frail and wide-eyed, asks why he withholds his touch when he so clearly holds the Morninglord's favor. Milos sighs and relents, explaining that he is nothing more than a servant of Lathander, fulfilling his duty.

But the explanation falls on deaf ears. Awe blooms in the man’s expression, as though he gazes upon a saint descended from the heavens. Irritated, Milos snaps, cutting through the reverence with sharp words. He is no saint, no divine herald—merely a man who worships the Morninglord, nothing more. If they wish to pray, they may, but zealotry has no place here, nor should they force their beliefs on others. He reinforces Wachter's authority, declaring her the best hope for Vallaki’s survival.

Still, the sick man’s eyes glisten with tears, stubbornly seeing salvation where Milos offers only practicality. Frustration boiling over, Milos threatens bodily harm to anyone who dares treat him as a savior. He moves through the room, healing each person swiftly, without ceremony, and leaves without another word.

Back at the residence of the Shards of Dawn, Milos storms inside, seething. He recounts the evening’s events to Ziva—the attempts at decency, the healing offered without expectation, and the infuriating result. Now, the people see him as a saint, a mantle he refuses to bear. He declares, with finality, that he will never embrace priesthood. People, in his view, are fools, and he wants no part in their hero worship.

Ziva listens, amusement curling at the edges of her exhaustion. She recognizes the inevitability of what Milos refuses to see: the people he healed will speak, and whispers will grow into a movement. A cult in his name seems almost fated now. The thought is absurd, and in the dark humor of the moment, she can't help but laugh.

A little later, at the Shards of Dawn’s new residence in Vallaki, final preparations for departure are underway. As they ready themselves to leave, Blinski arrives to see them off. He inquires about their return, and the party estimates it will be a matter of days.

Ziva entrusts Brumi’s care to Blinski, but the conversation quickly derails when Milos and Tian successfully convince the toymaker that the key to a woman's heart lies in making exceedingly suggestive comments. Blinski takes their words to heart, much to the party’s amusement.

Meanwhile, Piddlewick gears up to accompany the party. Blinski assures them of the construct’s durability, explaining that his arcane gemstone heart possesses minor self-repairing capabilities, rendering him virtually indestructible. Milos, unimpressed, expresses a desire to test this claim, hinting at dismantling the automaton just to see how resilient he truly is. At this, Blinski reluctantly accepts that Piddlewick is now his permanent responsibility.

Blinski tells the party that previous examination of the construct revealed inscriptions on his components, marking him as centuries old and originally manufactured for the Delisnya family. Despite his origins, both Ziva and Milos attempt to instill some discipline, urging Piddlewick to protect Blinski from unwelcome intruders while leaving Piccolo unharmed.

Ireena proposes a plan—Blinski should demonstrate his inventions to Fiona Wachter, securing her favor and thereby gaining the burgomaster’s blessing to avoid future imprisonment. She also suggests that he could request materials from Wachter, particularly diamonds, and discreetly pass them along to the party. Though hesitant, Blinski prepares a small mechanical light for the demonstration.

With the plan in place, Milos, Tian, and Blinski set off for Wachterhaus to present their proposal.

Upon arrival, the trio is met by Ernst, as insufferable as ever. Choosing to ignore him, they proceed directly to Fiona Wachter, who is engrossed in reviewing important documents. Though she had instructed not to be disturbed, she makes time for Milos and Tian upon recognizing them.

Milos presents their proposition: Blinski will craft and tinker with inventions aimed at improving life in Vallaki, in exchange for materials and protection. To demonstrate, he unveils Blinski’s tinkered light. Wachter is immediately impressed, expressing surprise that the toymaker possesses such ingenuity.

When she inquires about its mechanics, Blinski eagerly launches into a detailed technical explanation. To the party’s surprise, Wachter appears genuinely interested, listening intently. Convinced of the potential benefits for Vallaki, she agrees to the proposal, assigning guards for Blinski’s protection and ensuring that all necessary materials will be provided for her commissioned works.

A handshake seals the deal, and the trio departs.

With the party reunited, final preparations are swiftly completed. They bid farewell to Blinski, gather their belongings, and leave Vallaki, heading westward.

Along the road, they encounter Claude, who eagerly inquires about their next destination. Ziva  delivers a wildly exaggerated version of their upcoming journey, much to Claude’s delight.

With spirits high, the party presses forward, leaving the town behind.

As the Shards of Dawn leave Vallaki behind, the weight of Barovia settles upon them once more. The cobbled roads give way to winding dirt paths, slick with moisture and flanked by skeletal trees that reach toward the sky like grasping fingers. A thick, cloying mist clings to the ground, swirling around their boots and muffling their footsteps, as if the land itself conspires to swallow all sound. The oppressive silence is broken only by the distant howls of unseen beasts and the occasional rustling in the underbrush, a constant reminder that in Barovia, they are never truly alone.

As the party follows the road that once led to the Vistani settlement, Arabelle slows Moonshade’s pace, guiding the horse toward a pair of trees where a message has been left behind. Scrawled in careful script, the words read:

*"May moonlight bless us on our travels and everyone in our family who reads this. We are gathering dorocks."*

With little else to decipher from the note, the journey continues westward toward a small, isolated settlement known as Duskswallow. Along the way, Ziva immerses herself in *Van Richten’s Guide to Werewolves*, flipping through its aged pages as the road stretches ahead. Milos, seeking guidance, approaches an old man for directions. Though wary and visibly uneasy, the man hesitantly points the way, his voice low and anxious as he warns of strange occurrences in the woods. Travelers, he says, vanish without a trace, and the night is no longer safe for those who walk it.

The village of Duskswallow emerges from the mist like a forgotten relic, its thatched roofs sagging and its dirt paths lined with homes worn by time and hardship. The air carries the scent of damp wood and decay, and the few villagers who linger outside keep their eyes lowered, shoulders hunched against the ever-present dread of their surroundings.

Seeking answers, the party approaches an elderly woman named Eddy, whose wrinkled hands tremble as she regards them with suspicion—especially Tian, whose presence unsettles her most. Only after repeated assurances that no harm will come to her does she finally speak. Gilli, she explains, has been missing for seven days. She wandered into the forest after dark and never returned. She is not the first. Those who enter the woods at night are never seen again.

Her voice drops to a whisper as she mentions Gilli’s husband, Niels, the village hunter. With a frail hand, she gestures toward their home, the weight of unspoken fears settling between them as the party prepares to seek him out.

The party arrives at the home of Niels and Gilli, a modest dwelling on the outskirts of Duskswallow. Sally and Tian take the lead, inspecting the surroundings for anything out of the ordinary. Scattered bones, well-worn tools for skinning and trapping, and a bear pelt left to dry in the fading light hint at Niels’ trade as a hunter.

Milos knocks on the door, and after a moment’s hesitation, Niels answers. His expression is guarded, his posture tense. Ziva steps forward, addressing both Niels and Mariette—Gilli’s sister, who shares the home with him. She mentions that they were sent by Brumi after she received a strange letter from Gilli. At the mention of Gilli’s name, Niels’ wary demeanor shifts, sadness overtaking his features. He opens the door fully, allowing the party inside.

The party arrives at the home of Niels and Gilli, a modest dwelling on the outskirts of Duskswallow. Sally and Tian take the lead, inspecting the surroundings for anything out of the ordinary. Scattered bones, well-worn tools for skinning and trapping, and a bear pelt left to dry in the fading light hint at Niels’ trade as a hunter.

Milos knocks on the door, and after a moment’s hesitation, Niels answers. His expression is guarded, his posture tense. Ziva steps forward, addressing both Niels and Mariette—Gilli’s sister, who shares the home with him. At the mention of Brumi’s name, Niels’ wary demeanor shifts, sadness overtaking his features. He opens the door fully, allowing the party inside.

Ziva begins asking about Gilli’s disappearance. Niels recounts their last evening together: they shared supper at dusk before he gathered his weapons and left for a night of hunting. When he returned at dawn, the door stood ajar and Gilli was gone. He has searched the woods endlessly, retracing her possible steps, but found nothing. Desperation creeping into his voice, he admits that he planned to travel to Vallaki, hoping to hire skilled hunters and trackers to aid in the search.

Mariette corroborates his story, explaining that after Niels left, she and Gilli drank tea before retiring for the night. She recalls hearing Gilli’s door open but assumed her sister had merely stepped out briefly.

Tian, ever observant, notes the slight hesitation in Mariette’s words, sensing that she is not telling the whole truth. Subtly, he signals Milos. Catching on, Milos pulls Niels aside, proposing that they head into the woods together and instructing him to gather his equipment.

Meanwhile, Tian discreetly alerts Ziva, who shifts her attention to Mariette. With a calm but firm tone, Ziva assures her that the party will do everything in their power to find Gilli—but only if they have the full truth.

Mariette hesitates before finally confessing. She had heard Gilli leave her room that night and had confronted her before she could slip away. Gilli had been adamant—something was wrong with Niels’ frequent hunts, and she intended to find out what. Mariette followed, pleading with her to turn back, but Gilli would not be swayed.

They had reached the forest’s edge when Mariette made a final desperate attempt to stop her. Gilli, however, remained resolute. She had grown suspicious of Niels’ constant empty-handed returns and was determined to uncover the truth. Without another word, she vanished into the trees. Mariette had waited anxiously for her sister to come back. She never did. That was seven days ago.

Ziva presses further, asking about the letter Brumi received only three days prior. Mariette lowers her gaze, admitting that she was the one who wrote it. She already knows her sister is dead—she only wanted to spare Brumi from unnecessary grief.

Ziva’s next question is pointed: does Mariette fear Niels? But Mariette is unwavering. Niels is a good man, she insists, undeserving of suspicion. What she does fear, however, is that Niels will throw his life away in pursuit of vengeance. Her voice breaks as she begs the party to let this go, to tell Niels that Gilli is gone so he can grieve in peace.

But the party does not waver. A promise was made to Brumi, and they intend to keep it.

At that moment, Niels returns, ready for the search. Sally steps forward, requesting something of Gilli’s. Niels retrieves a piece of her clothing and hands it over. Before he or Mariette can react, Sally’s form begins to shift, bones stretching and twisting as her body expands into that of a dire wolf. She lowers her snout to the fabric, inhaling deeply before raising her head—she has caught the scent.

Horror flashes across Niels and Mariette’s faces, but Ziva assures them that Sally is very gifted. The party, with Niels at their side, follows Sally as she begins to track Gilli’s path into the darkened woods.

Sally follows Gilli’s scent through the dense undergrowth while Niels guides the party carefully through the terrain, ensuring they avoid his hidden traps. His skill as a hunter becomes evident as he navigates with ease, pointing out signs of recent movement and the subtle shifts in the forest that indicate danger. Along the way, he speaks of a wolf pack that has been terrorizing the village for some time. The party agrees to help put an end to the threat.

As they push deeper into the forest, Sally suddenly catches a stronger trace of Gilli’s scent. Following her lead, the party stumbles upon a hat, discarded in the underbrush. It is identical to the one Mariette was wearing, but before anyone can voice their suspicions, Niels immediately recognizes it as Gilli’s. The way it lies—hastily tossed rather than dropped—suggests she was running, fleeing from something.

Scanning the area, Ziva’s sharp eyes pick up numerous wolf tracks embedded in the soft earth, but something else stands out—larger, more monstrous prints, too deep and too wide to belong to any ordinary wolf. Her warning comes just in time.

From the shadows, seven massive wolves emerge, their eyes gleaming with unnatural intelligence. They move with deadly coordination, muscles rippling beneath thick fur as they prepare to strike. These are no ordinary beasts. The moment their fangs flash in the dim light, the party recognizes them for what they are—Volenta’s wolves.

With a sudden burst of speed, the creatures lunge, and battle erupts in the heart of the cursed forest. The party quickly realizes that these wolves are unlike any they have faced before. Their bites carry a venomous sting, their bodies stronger and more resilient than those of natural wolves. Surrounded and outnumbered, the party steels themselves, knowing this is no mere skirmish—this is a fight for survival.

The battle begins, and the Shards of Dawn fight as one to take down the ravenous, modified wolves.

Sally commands the very essence of the forest—trees, plants, rocks, and even the soil beneath their feet—unleashing nature’s wrath to devastate the wolves. Tian takes to the air, striking with quick, precise jabs before darting out of reach. Milos charges three of the seven wolves, swinging his flail with reckless abandon, his very presence radiating fear.

Ziva calls upon the radiance of dawn, scorching the pack before *Misty Stepping* into a higher tree, securing a vantage point and evading the wolves’ venomous bites. Ireena wields both rapier and crossbow with deadly efficiency, while Arabelle, guided by her foresight, nimbly avoids every attack. She stays close to Ireena and Niels, ready to teleport them into the Ethereal Plane if the wolves become overwhelming.

In a short time, the battle is won. The Shards of Dawn emerge largely unscathed.

Milos immediately drops beside a slain wolf, already skinning it for the pelt. As he works, slow applause echoes from the shadows.

Volenta steps into view, amusement flickering in her smile. She declares that the party has provided excellent entertainment and takes her leave—but not before raising the slain wolves with necromantic power. The freshly killed creatures stir, now mindless undead, and obediently follow her into the darkness.

Watching the display, Niels grows visibly uneasy. The sheer power Volenta wields—and the implications of traveling with the party—begin to sink in. Milos quickly explains who she is and reassures Niels, pulling him back from the edge of a panic attack.

Just as he regains composure, Tian casually remarks that, at the very least, Volenta didn’t bring the shadow dragon this time. The color drains from Niels’s face, and he spirals into panic once more.

With nothing left to do here, the party resumes their search for Gilli. Sally transforms into a giant eagle, soaring above the forest to gain a better view, while Ziva and Arabelle track footprints she spotted before the wolves attacked. The trail leads them to a sparser section of the forest, where they notice deep drag marks and torn trees ahead.

The trail of drag marks ends in a small clearing. A woman’s upper body lies discarded on the forest floor, torn apart.

Niels lets out a wail and rushes to her side, cradling her lifeless form as tears stream down his face. Gilli.

Ziva studies the tracks leading to the scene, analyzing the brutal wounds. The larger, monstrous prints belong to a werewolf—it is almost certain that Gilli’s death was at the hands of one. She steps closer to Niels, placing a hand on his shoulder as he weeps over his wife’s corpse.

Above, Sally—still in her eagle form—spots movement in the underbrush. Amid Niels’ anguished cries, she hears the telltale creak of a bowstring drawn taut. Before she can sound a warning, an arrow flies from the shadows, striking Niels in the arm and pinning him to the ground beside Gilli.

The party immediately shifts into defensive positions. Milos steps in front of Niels, raising his flail, prepared to intercept any further attacks.

From the foliage, a tall, slender woman emerges, her confident stride marred by something unnatural. A hunting bow remains in her grasp, her fingers still lingering over the string. Dark curls frame her scarred face and keen, watchful eyes. Vistani garb clings to her form, a rapier hanging at her belt. Her right leg, from the knee down, is crafted from metal—a prosthetic, worn but well-maintained.

She makes no apologies, simply states her intent: she is hunting a werewolf. Her bow shifts toward Niels, her voice unwavering as she demands the party step aside. She declares that Niels is no ordinary werewolf—he is old, powerful, and dangerous.

The party moves to defend him, but Ziva stiffens, brittle with tension. She demands the woman’s name and tells her to back off. To her credit, the stranger barely acknowledges Ziva, her focus on Niels unwavering. Yet, her expression softens slightly at the sight of the grieving man, still clutching Gilli’s broken form.

Milos, wanting clarity, acts impulsively—he bites Niels. The moment his teeth sink into flesh, he recoils, spitting with disgust. Werewolf blood. Undrinkable to a vampire. The truth is undeniable now.

Niels, his face stricken with grief and guilt, does not deny it. He admits to being a werewolf but insists he has always sought to control it. Whenever he senses the beast stirring, he isolates himself in a cabin deep in the woods, locking himself away to ensure no harm comes to others. His voice breaks as he looks down at Gilli’s mangled remains. He swears he does not remember this. He prays, begs, that it was not him—because if he hurt Gilli, if he killed her, he will not be able to live with himself. His sobs deepen, raw and unrestrained.

Milos and Tian step forward, introducing themselves. The Vistani woman, in turn, gives them her name—Ezmeralda.

Ziva watches her closely, noting the air of charm about her, so reminiscent of Arabelle. Something about her presence, her bearing, stirs a distant memory. She quietly asks Arabelle if she senses the presence of a *rauni*—a Vistani seer. Arabelle squints, studying Ezmeralda for a moment before nodding. Yes, there is definitely something of the *rauni* in her.

Testing a suspicion, Ziva introduces herself with her full name. Then, carefully, she asks for Ezmeralda’s family name. But Ezmeralda refuses to give it. She does not know who Ziva is, nor does she trust her.

Shifting her attention, Ezmeralda turns to Tian. With perceptive ease, she correctly deduces that he is either a wereraven or an aarakocra, her curiosity seemingly genuine as she questions him about his heritage. Tian, ever eager to share, answers readily and ventures a guess of his own: Ezmeralda is the wandering Vistana Madame Eva spoke of—the one searching for her master.

Ezmeralda scoffs but does not deny it. She admits that she is looking for him, but she does not yet know who he is.

When Ziva presses further, asking who this master might be, Ezmeralda reveals the name: *Rudolf van Richten.*

The pieces click into place. Ziva realizes, without a doubt, that this is the same Ezmeralda she once knew. But she does not say it. Not yet. She does not trust Ezmeralda, and she suspects Ezmeralda feels the same. Instead, she simply informs her that van Richten is alive.

As the conversation unfolds, Niels remains slumped over Gilli’s body, his grief consuming him. Ezmeralda does not waver. A werewolf as powerful as Niels cannot simply be left unchecked. How is this to be handled?

Her words finally break through the haze of Niels’ sorrow. His voice sharpens with anger. He has seen many battles, but that life is behind him. He loved Gilli—*truly* loved her—and now she is gone. But none of this makes sense. Why had she come so deep into the woods?

Milos answers, recounting Mariette’s words about that fateful night. Niels listens, his expression shifting from anguish to grim determination. Lifting Gilli’s broken form into his arms, he turns to the party and demands they take him back to Duskswallow. He must confront Mariette.

The party agrees. Ezmeralda falls into step beside them as they set off toward Duskswallow.

As the party makes its way back to Duskswallow, Milos speaks with Ezmeralda, delving deeper into the nature of his condition. He assures her that his transformation was forced upon him—that he had no choice in becoming what he is.

Ezmeralda listens but remains guarded, admitting that she struggles to see creatures like vampires and werewolves as anything other than monsters. Raised by Van Richten as a hunter, she has spent her life believing that such beings are nothing more than prey.

Milos, unfazed, remarks that in that regard, they are not so different. He, too, takes pleasure in hunting vampires, turning the predator into the prey.

Ezmeralda shifts her attention to Arabelle, inclining her head slightly in acknowledgment. She mentions that she has read much about the young Vistana, a revelation that delights Arabelle. With a bright grin, Arabelle announces to Ziva that Ezmeralda is "one of them," before proudly declaring that Ziva is her sister.

Intrigued, Ezmeralda steps closer to Ziva, studying her with newfound interest. She asks if it is true—if Ziva really is Arabelle’s sister—already beginning to piece together the truth of her identity.

Ziva, ever playful, feigns surprise that Ezmeralda did not notice the resemblance sooner. Once again, she presses for a family name.

With a resigned sigh, Ezmeralda relents, revealing it at last: d'Avenir. Before Ziva can say anything further, Ezmeralda asks her to save any questions for later—once the matter at hand has been resolved.

Ziva simply shrugs, a knowing smile tugging at her lips. She tells Ezmeralda that it has been a long time and walks away, drawing a small smile from the huntress.

As the party reaches the edge of the forest with Niels and Ezmeralda in tow, Milos separates from the group, seeking out Mariette under the pretense that something has happened to Niels.

Upon hearing the news, Mariette follows without hesitation. But when they arrive and she sees Gilli’s mutilated corpse, she breaks down, sobbing.

The party presses her for answers, their questioning relentless. Niels, too, begins to demand the truth, his patience wearing thin. Under the weight of their accusations, Mariette finally confesses. She has been in love with Niels for some time and, only recently, uncovered his secret—his curse. He is a werewolf. Believing this revelation would be a dealbreaker for Gilli, Mariette orchestrated a cruel betrayal. On a night when Niels was transforming, she lured her sister into the forest, convinced that if Gilli saw the truth, she would leave him. In her mind, this was the only way. If Gilli was gone, Niels would be free to start a life with her.

She never meant for her sister to die. She only wanted her out of the way.

At her words, something in Niels snaps. Fury twists his expression as his body begins to change. His nails lengthen, muscles strain, and his teeth sharpen into fangs. With terrifying speed, he seizes Mariette by the throat and lifts her into the air, his grip tightening as she gasps for breath.

Mariette struggles, pleading desperately. She loves him. She trusts him in a way Gilli never could. The words only enrage him further. He tightens his hold, preparing to snap her neck.

Ziva steps forward, voice steady but firm. Killing Mariette will not bring Gilli back. Niels growls, his eyes wild. He does not care. He wants justice. He wants revenge. And then, he demands, they should kill him, too. Ziva nods—and steps aside.

Sally, horrified, refuses to stand by and watch another life be taken. She casts *Hold Person* on both Niels and Mariette, her voice rising in frustration. More bloodshed will solve nothing.

For a long moment, the only sound is Mariette’s choked sobbing. She begs for her life, professing her love over and over as Niels fights against the magic binding his body. The party stands motionless, unwilling to interfere further.

Sally searches their faces, waiting for someone—anyone—to act. But no one does. With a bitter curse, she releases them both.

Niels does not hesitate. He tears into Mariette, ending her life in an instant. Blood stains the forest floor. As her body crumples, he looks up, his eyes full of sorrow and fury. He has taken his vengeance, and now he demands his own execution.

When asked if he has any final wishes, he does not hesitate. He wishes to be buried beside Gilli—far away from Mariette.

Milos acknowledges his request. Without a word, he lifts his blade and, in a single, fluid motion, decapitates him.

As Tian examines the remains, he finds an amulet, its surface carved with the image of a wolf howling at the moon atop a cliff’s edge. Ezmeralda inspects the token, her expression unreadable. Niels, she concludes, once belonged to the old pack from the west. He must have defected before the pack’s leadership changed hands.

The party carries out Niels’ final request, burying him beside Gilli while Mariette’s grave lies apart. When the grim task is done, they decide to stay the night in what was once Niels’ and Gilli’s home. Ezmeralda is invited to join them, but she declines, choosing instead to bring her caravan next to the house and spend the night there.

Sally, still seething, refuses to remain with the group. She needs space. Without waiting for permission, she follows Ezmeralda into the darkness, despite the Vistana’s protests that she does not want company.

While Sally travels with Ezmeralda to retrieve her caravan, Tian returns to the former home of Niels, Gilli, and Mariette, setting about preparing food for the evening. Meanwhile, Ziva and Milos seek out Eddy.

Ziva regretfully informs her that the party ventured deep into the forest with Niels and Mariette to search for Gilli but were ambushed by wolves. Neither Niels nor Mariette made it out.

Eddy listens in quiet distress, mourning the loss of her people. Without Niels, she acknowledges, the village will likely starve—he was the only hunter among them. When Ziva and Milos suggest reaching out to Vallaki for aid or establishing trade with other villages, Eddy refuses both options outright, insisting they will manage somehow.

With that, she closes the door in their faces, leaving Ziva and Milos momentarily stunned by the abruptness of the encounter. As they walk back to the hunter’s house, Ziva turns to Milos and asks what he thinks of Ezmeralda.

Milos is blunt—he sees her as dangerous and untrustworthy. While she remains nearby, he intends to sleep close to his weapons. He elaborates further, expressing deep distrust toward anyone who has worked with or still works alongside Van Richten. When Ziva presses him on his reasoning, he simply states that Van Richten inspires a particular kind of zealotry in his followers.

Ziva admits that she once attempted to contact Van Richten when the Shards of Dawn got high on Vistana’s Coochie in Tser’s Pool. She also confesses to having a strange feeling about him—one she cannot yet define or fully grasp.

Upon returning to the house, they find Tian still in the midst of preparing food.

As Tian cooks, Milos busies himself with crafting a wolf pelt cloak for Arabelle. However, when he presents it to her, she wrinkles her nose in distaste. It isn’t her style, she declares, and she dislikes the idea of an animal dying for her to wear it. After some gentle persuasion, she reluctantly puts it on, though it is clear she loathes it.

Meanwhile, Ziva, bored, begins searching the house. In a hidden compartment within Niels and Gilli’s chamber, she uncovers a stack of papers. Curious, she reads them and quickly realizes they are a fragment of Niel’s diary, writing about his old life:

*“The Wolfvir are no more. Emil’s plan has failed, and Kiril Stoyanovich is now the Alpha.*  
*I will leave. I wish my brothers strength.”*

While this is happening, Sally trails behind Ezmeralda through the dense woodland, her mood sullen. As they move, she takes note of the Vistani woman’s peculiar habits—spitting on tree roots, rubbing soil onto her palms, and other small gestures that seem deliberate. When questioned, Ezmeralda simply calls it Vistani magic and offers no further explanation.

Navigating through the thick foliage, she eventually leads Sally into a hidden clearing, where a purple-painted barrel-top wagon stands, camouflaged by the same kind of magic Ezmeralda has used before. The caravan, though small and clearly suited for just one traveler, lacks any horses. Without hesitation, Ezmeralda climbs onto the driver's perch and asks whether Sally prefers to walk or ride.

Sally chooses to climb up beside her, and with a quiet muttering of the word **“Drovash,”** two spectral horses materialize, harnessed and ready. As the wagon lurches forward, the conversation shifts to the events of the past day. Sally brings up Niels' decision to kill Mariette, questioning whether it was the right call. Ezmeralda, with her years of experience, does not offer certainty. She has been trained to stay uninvolved. Her focus was on the death of Niels. If allowing Niels to take Mariette’s life gave him some semblance of peace before his own end, then so be it.

But that is not the only thing on Ezmeralda’s mind. With an assessing gaze, she brings up Milos, noting his nature as a vampire. For more than thirty years, she has hunted monsters, yet she finds it surprising that the party chooses to travel with one. A quiet warning follows—Milos is dangerous, and Sally would do well to be careful around him.

Sally, startled by the number Ezmeralda gives, cannot help but ask how someone who looks barely twenty-five has been hunting for three decades. Ezmeralda only smiles before revealing the truth: she is seventy-four years old. The conversation circles back to Milos, but this time, Ezmeralda adds that, despite his nature, she has her reasons for not indulging her instincts when it comes to him. His restraint is remarkable—especially for a vampire in Barovia, where those of his kind are often far more frenzied than their counterparts in the outside world.

The rest of the journey passes in silence, and soon, the trees thin, revealing the outskirts of the village.

The group invites Ezmeralda to dine with them and she agrees as long as they dine outside. When the party agrees, Ezmeralda sets to work, gathering wood for a fire with a speed and efficiency that even Sally cannot match. She arranges the logs in an intricate pattern before igniting a sturdy flame.

Disappearing briefly into the woods, she returns with two satchels filled with berries and other foraged goods, once again proving her skill at surviving on the road. As she sets them down, she moves toward Moonshade, stroking the horse’s mane and whispering softly in the Vistani tongue. The mare responds with evident enjoyment, leaning into the touch, basking in the attention.

Tian emerges from the house carrying a pot of freshly cooked food, and the group gathers around the fire.

Ziva takes a place beside Sally, her posture tense, and addresses the unspoken tension between them. Sally is angry, and Ziva knows why—because the party made no move to stop Niels. But from Ziva’s perspective, her conscience remains clear. Mariette’s actions led to Gilli’s death. Even if she had not wielded the blade herself, the end result was the same. By any law, she would have been found guilty and hanged for her crimes. Allowing Niels to avenge his wife before his own death had been an act of mercy.

Sally, however, remains unmoved. In her eyes, Mariette did not deserve to die, and by standing by and allowing it to happen, the party is no better than the man who killed her.

Milos interjects, his tone unwavering. Stopping Niels had never been an option. If they had tried, he would have shifted into his werewolf form and attacked, and in their exhausted state, they would not have survived the fight.

Despite the reasoning presented, Sally does not relent. The weight of Mariette’s death lingers, pressing down like a stone in her chest.

As the conversation lulls, Ezmeralda begins casting **Detect Magic**, her sharp gaze sweeping over the group as she quietly assesses the enchantments woven into their possessions. Once satisfied, she reaches into one of the many satchels at her belt, pulling out dark mushrooms. With practiced movements, she crushes them, mixing the spores with other ingredients to create **Corpse Blight**, a potent concoction designed to harm the undead.

Amid the quiet, Arabelle’s voice pipes up with an idea—**doroks**, Vistani stories. The suggestion is met with approval, and as the fire crackles, Ezmeralda leans forward and begins to weave a tale—the legend of **Madame Petrescu’s Curse.**

**\*\*Dorok: Madame Petrescu’s Curse\*\***

“*Madame Petrescu was a noblewoman—wealthy, well-dressed, and full of herself. She lived in Vallaki long ago, when the town was ruled by lesser men than today. She fancied herself above others, and she had a sharp tongue that she used like a dagger. One day, a Vistani seer came to her estate, offering a glimpse into her fate.*  
*'Beware your words,' the seer warned. ‘A voice that cuts deep invites deeper wounds.’*  
*But Madame Petrescu only laughed. 'What nonsense\!' she sneered. 'You charlatans spin tales like spiders spin webs—delicate, empty, and easy to sweep away\!'*  
*The seer merely smiled, as Vistani do when they know something the rest of the world does not. She whispered something under her breath, words the noblewoman ignored. Then, without another word, she left.*  
*That night, at a grand feast, Madame Petrescu drank deeply of her own importance, weaving lies and gossip, using her words to destroy reputations, shatter friendships, and twist truth into weapons. She was a master of her craft, or so she thought. But as the night went on, something… changed.*  
*Her lips trembled, her throat clenched, and suddenly, the words spilling from her mouth were not her own. Dark truths came forth—secrets she had never dared admit, confessions she had sworn never to make. She tried to stop, but her own voice betrayed her. Every lie she spoke turned to truth. Every manipulation unraveled before her eyes.*  
*By dawn, she had lost everything. Friends, allies, status. Even her family cast her out, fearing what else she might reveal.*  
*Desperate, she sought out the Vistani seer, begging for mercy. But the seer only shook her head. 'Your tongue has wielded too many blades,' she said. 'Now it cuts only you.'*  
*Madame Petrescu fled into the night, silencing herself in the only way she knew how.*  
*But even that was not enough. Her thoughts—her very mind—began to betray her. Even with no tongue, her voice still echoed through the wind, whispering her deepest shames into the ears of strangers. No one knows where she went in the end. Some say she walked into the Mists, hoping they would take her. Others claim you can still hear her voice on quiet nights, carried by the wind, warning others to mind their tongues… before it’s too late.*"

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Milos, eager to take part in the storytelling circle, retrieves the copy of *Van Richten’s Guide to the Vistani* that he borrowed from Lady Wachter. As soon as Ezmeralda catches sight of the title, her expression darkens. A sharp curse escapes her lips in Vistani, her anger flaring at the sight of the book. Without hesitation, she demands to borrow it for the night, her voice carrying an edge that leaves little room for argument.

Milos, unfazed, agrees and casually flips through the worn pages. His fingers pause on **The Tale of the Unlit Candle**, his eyes scanning the text as the fire crackles between them, and he begins to read it aloud:

**\*\*Dorok: The Tale of the Unlit Candle\*\***

*“Fate is a funny thing. Some spend their lives trying to shape it, to wrestle it into something they can control. Others think they can outrun it. But there are some who, no matter where they go or what they do, are marked—born beneath a shadow they can never escape.*  
*There was a girl once—no one remembers her name now, but the Vistani call her the Lost One. She was young, full of dreams, full of life, and she had nothing to her name except her own stubborn will. She wanted to leave behind the place of her birth, to seek her fortune beyond the forests, beyond the rivers, beyond the Mists.*  
*One evening, she came upon an old Vistani crone, hunched and ancient, stirring a fire beneath a sky heavy with stars.*  
*‘Tell me my future,’ the girl demanded.*  
*The crone studied her for a long time before reaching into her robes and pulling out a single, waxen candle—plain, simple, unmarked. She pressed it into the girl’s hand.*  
*‘This candle will burn only when you are safe,’ the crone told her. ‘Light it whenever you wish, but heed what it tells you.’*  
*The girl scoffed but took the candle anyway. A gift is a gift, after all.*  
*And so she set out on her journey.*  
*On her first night, alone on the road, she struck a match and touched it to the wick. But the candle would not light.*  
*She thought the wax was poor, the wick damp. She tried again the next night. And the next.*  
*Nothing.*  
*She wandered from town to town, from village to village, seeking work, shelter, a place to rest—but the candle never burned. And everywhere she went, trouble found her. Storms struck. Thieves lurked. Strangers whispered behind her back.*  
*She grew older, traveling farther, seeking a home, a place where the candle might finally glow.*  
*But it never did.*  
*Desperation turned to dread. She climbed mountains, crossed rivers, sought holy places, grand halls, and quiet cottages. But still—the wick remained cold.*  
*One night, she returned to where she had first met the Vistani crone, her hands shaking as she held up the candle. ‘Why won’t it burn?’ she cried. ‘Why have I never been safe?’*  
*The crone looked at her with sorrow in her old eyes and said, ‘Child, you were born beneath a dark star. You were never meant to be safe. The candle will never burn for you.’*  
*The girl stood there, silent, before she turned and walked into the Mists.*  
*She was never seen again.*  
*But the candle—ah, the candle—was found the next morning, resting where she had stood. Unlit. Waiting. Still waiting.*

*Not everyone gets to escape their fate. Some roads lead only into darkness.”*

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After finishing the story, Milos hands Ezmeralda the book on Susebron Dawnfire, curious to hear her thoughts as someone well-traveled. She flips through its pages, but nothing sparks recognition. Whoever this figure was, she has never heard of him.

Milos shares what he and Ziva have seen in their visions—glimpses of a gold-skinned individual—and explains his ongoing quest to uncover more about this mysterious figure. He believes the man to be significant, maybe even his past life. 

He continues by saying that both Lathander and Strahd seem to have a vested interest in him. At those words, Ezmeralda’s expression darkens, though she remains silent.

A moment passes before she finally speaks, asking if the party would be open to her traveling with them for a while. The party agrees without hesitation.

Sally then turns to Ziva, voicing a thought that has been lingering in her mind: is it possible that Villeneuve arrived in Barovia long before Ziva did? Ziva immediately dismisses the idea, recalling that she was following him into the forest when she lost track of him. She made camp for the night, but when she woke, she was in Barovia.

Sally points out that by the time the party encountered him, Villeneuve was already known as the Mad Mage, which suggests he had been in Barovia for quite some time. Ziva offers another explanation—she believes the party is in a different plane of existence entirely. Time, she argues, can behave strangely when passing between planes. She recalls her own past journey to the Feywild, where she spent a month, only to return to Waterdeep and find that only two weeks had passed.

Tian, intrigued, asks when Ziva first entered the mists. She answers without hesitation: the 20th of Eleint, just before the equinox. Tian's eyes widen as he realizes that he entered the mists months after that date—perhaps five months later.

Sally nods in agreement, stating that she also entered the mists around the same time as Tian, perhaps a few weeks apart, but certainly closer to him than to Ziva.

Confusion flickers across Ziva’s face. If she entered the mists first, that would mean she spent the most time wandering within them—yet she remembers nothing of the sort. She recalls only falling asleep in the forest and waking up in Barovia.

Ezmeralda listens carefully before interjecting, explaining that non-Vistani who enter the mists often wander, becoming lost within them.

Ziva stiffens at the claim, reiterating that she never wandered—she simply slept and woke up here. And besides, she *is* Vistani, at least in part, which should mean she is not subject to the same difficulties as others.

At that, Arabelle turns to Ezmeralda with certainty. Ziva, she states, is not only Vistani—she is a *rauni*, just like Madame Eva and herself. A special one.

Ezmeralda studies Ziva for a long moment before asking whether she has ever seen visions of herself. Ziva hesitates. She isn’t sure. What she has seen—were they visions? Or merely memories she has buried too deep to recall?

With yet another mystery added to their growing list, the Shards of Dawn recognize the late hour and turn their attention to deciphering the next chapter of the ***Tome of Strahd***. When Ezmeralda inquires about it, Ziva presents the book, explaining its nature and purpose.

Intrigued, Ezmeralda listens intently as the party details their agreement with Strahd: they have a limited amount until Strahd will come to reclaim the book, and he has promised them he will not make reading from it simple. After considering the risks, she offers to set up protective wards around them. Once the protections are in place, she joins Ziva in deciphering the next chapter. The process unfolds smoothly, revealing the title: *The Last Dusk.*

With the chapter prepared, Ziva proposes that Arabelle shift the party into the Ethereal Plane, ensuring Strahd’s creatures cannot reach them. Arabelle obliges, transporting them all beyond the veil of the material world. Yet when Ziva attempts to read from the ***Tome***, nothing happens.

Realization dawns—the book’s magic is intrinsically tied to Strahd. It will only function on the same plane of existence as its master. Resigned, the party returns to the material plane. This time, as the title is spoken aloud, the ever-present mists begin to coil and roll in around them.

Strahd’s voice echoes through the fog, narrating as before:

*"I wish you had somebody like me, Tatyana. But I will, I thought.*  
*This day, the day I sealed my fate, I laid here on paper so I would remember it."*

The mists roll and the scene shifts, solidifying into the courtyard of Castle Ravenloft’s chapel.

Music drifts through the air, lively and elegant. Dozens of finely dressed guests mill about in celebration, laughter and conversation filling the space. A rare atmosphere of joy lingers in the courtyard. Above the chapel entrance, a stunning stained-glass window gleams in the sunlight, depicting a noble white knight and a red-haired bride, their hands entwined. The image is hauntingly familiar—the same window that lay shattered when the Shards of Dawn last visited Ravenloft.

Moving with the crowd, the party enters the chapel. Among the gathered nobles, many faces stand out—figures they have seen before in the ***Tome of Strahd***: the Dilisnyas (most notably, Leo), Patrina, Rahadin, Adral. Yet two key figures are absent—Alek Gwilym and Markovia are nowhere to be seen.

Tian’s gaze catches on a man escorting a young girl who bears an unmistakable resemblance to Fiona Wachter. This must be Lovina Wachter, Fiona’s ancestor.

As the Shards of Dawn advance further, their attention is drawn to the front of the chapel. There, dressed in pristine white, stands Sergei von Zarovich. His face is alight with joy, a warm, genuine smile gracing his features. At his waist rests the *Sunsword*, a symbol of his station. Beside him, motionless and unreadable, stands Strahd.

The party stands as honored guests at the grand event, free to mingle and converse with the other attendees. Among the notable figures present are Andral, Leo Dilisnya, Countess Dorfniya Dilisnya, the young Lovina Wachter, Patrina, Rahadin, Sergei, and, of course, Strahd himself.

The ceremony is set to begin in an hour. Until then, the party agrees to disperse, each seeking out key individuals in hopes of uncovering valuable information.

Before they part ways, Ziva pulls Ezmeralda aside and cautions her about the nature of the *Tome of Strahd*. This vision is a memory, an echo of what has already transpired. None of these people can be saved—most are long dead. She warns Ezmeralda to be vigilant; the pages of the *Tome* act much like the Mists. Death within this vision means being trapped within its pages, and unlike the Mists, the *Tome* grants no exceptions for the Vistani.

Additionally, Ziva stresses the importance of maintaining the illusion of the vision. Any action that disrupts the natural flow of events will result in the party being forcefully expelled. Their purpose here is to observe, to gather insight—not to interfere.

Ezmeralda admits she had briefly considered putting a crossbow bolt through Strahd’s skull, but after hearing Ziva’s warning, she concedes that no matter how tempting, the risk of being ejected isn’t worth it.

Ziva then directs Ezmeralda’s attention to Leo Dilisnya, presenting her with the letter written by Lovina Wachter. The letter describes a joyous wedding that turned into a massacre at the hands of her uncle, Leo. Ziva believes this is the very wedding where Leo will strike.

With the warning delivered, Ziva scans the crowd, taking note of the key players. As her gaze drifts to Sergei, she studies his attire—white robes adorned with gold trim, an ensemble befitting a Dawnmaster of the Morninglord. Yet, she finds no symbols of the Morninglord anywhere on his person. The absence is telling. Sergei must have willingly shed his title in order to marry.

Nearby, a group of highborn girls takes notice of Ireena, initially admiring her dress. However, upon learning that she crafted it herself, their tone shifts to derision, mocking her lack of servants.

Milos and Sally act swiftly. With a calculated movement, Milos subtly trips one of the girls, while Sally, with a flick of her fingers, manipulates the wine in her cup, sending it splashing across the expensive fabric of her gown.

With the minor distraction handled, the party splits up. Ziva, Arabelle, and Milos approach Andral. Sally and Ireena make their way to Sergei. Ezmeralda immerses herself among the guests, while Tian slips toward the chapel, scoping the area for any potential threats.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Ziva and Milos pass beneath the grand stained glass window above the chapel doors, they take in the image of Sergei and Tatyana, immortalized in wedding attire, hands clasped in devotion. Nearby, guests murmur about the window’s recent installation—commissioned by Strahd himself just two days prior.

Ziva turns to Milos, attempting to explain her observation that Sergei must have stepped down as Dawnmaster, given his attire. However, Milos repeatedly interrupts, insisting on addressing Andral as "Dawnmaster" to gauge his reaction. Arabelle, ever perceptive, dryly notes that Ziva and Milos seem to bring out the worst in each other.

They find Andral conversing with a small group of guests in the courtyard. Without hesitation, Milos greets him with the title of "Dawnmaster." Andral gently corrects him, explaining that Sergei now holds the title.

Ziva presses further, mentioning the vow of celibacy that typically accompanies such a position. Andral reveals that special accommodations were made to allow Sergei to marry, meaning that he remains unaware of Sergei's resignation. More importantly, it suggests that Sergei was never required to relinquish his title in the first place.

When asked what comes next for him now that he no longer holds the title, Andral simply states that he is old and weary. His only wish is to spend his remaining years in service to others.

His gaze drifts toward Strahd. When Milos remarks on the count, Andral acknowledges that Strahd has changed. Once a warrior who brought peace, he now carries a darkness within him—like a man who has lingered in the shadows for too long.

Andral studies Milos, his sharp eyes narrowing slightly. He remarks that Milos, too, carries a storm within him—something hidden, yet undeniable.

The tension of the moment is interrupted by a small child, clutching a delicate flower crown. She eagerly asks Andral to bless it, explaining that it is meant for the bride. Andral smiles, placing a hand over the crown and murmuring a quiet blessing before turning his attention back to Milos.

Seizing the opportunity, Milos describes the figure he has seen in his visions—a man with golden skin, adorned with symbols of the Morninglord tattooed across his body. Andral considers the description carefully but shows no recognition. After a moment of contemplation, he suggests that such visions are often a sign of acceptance—the Morninglord’s way of welcoming Milos into his service.

Ziva, ever probing, shifts the topic to a more controversial subject. She inquires whether the Morninglord would ever accept an undead follower into his service. Andral immediately bristles at the notion, prepared to dismiss it outright. But before he can, Ziva clarifies—hypothetically speaking—what if the undead had been turned against their will and now actively sought redemption? She speaks of Milos but frames it as a theoretical question.

Andral falls silent, considering the scenario. After a pause, he concedes that the mercy of the Morninglord is vast. In exceptional cases, even a creature of undeath might find a path to redemption.

Still keen, Andral probes further, asking whether this hypothetical situation is, in fact, a real one. Milos smoothly deflects, claiming that he and Ziva often discuss controversial theological matters during their travels and merely sought an additional perspective.

With the conversation shifting, Ziva inquires about the officiant of the wedding ceremony. Andral explains that he has long since passed the responsibility to younger clerics. The one performing the ceremony will be Elona, and if the party seeks further insight, they should speak with her directly.

With that, the conversation reaches its natural end. Ziva and Milos thank Andral for his time before parting ways.

Milos remains in the courtyard, savoring the feel of the sun on his skin, while Ziva makes her way toward Leo Dilisnya.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the tense encounter with the noblewomen, Sally turns her attention to Ireena. Sally approaches her, noticing the distant, distracted look in her eyes. When she gently inquires about her well-being, Ireena hesitates before admitting that today holds great significance. It is overwhelming, yet strangely familiar—this is exactly how she once imagined her wedding as a child.

Their conversation drifts as they spot Sergei near a fountain outside, engaged in discussion with a group of priests. They make their way toward him, and as they approach, Sally takes note of his smile—warm on the surface, yet failing to reach his eyes.

They wait until he finishes speaking before Sally steps forward. With a casual air, she mentions a custom from distant lands: tossing a coin into a fountain and making a wish. She hands Sergei a small coin, and he obliges, flicking it into the air. It lands on the stone edge of the fountain rather than in the water. Ever the optimist, Sergei chuckles and insists he will take it as a good omen regardless.

Sally then offers her congratulations, asking how he is feeling on his wedding day. Sergei’s expression brightens with genuine joy. He proclaims his happiness—he is about to marry the most beautiful woman alive and still cannot believe his fortune that she accepted his proposal. But as his gaze drifts past Sally, lingering on Ireena, a flicker of something unspoken crosses his face. The resemblance does not go unnoticed. A pause, brief but perceptible, before he continues, wistfully stating that he wishes his parents were here to witness this day. At least, he adds, he still has his brother.

Yet as he speaks of Strahd, a shadow dims the light in his eyes. There is something burdening his brother, something concealed behind countless self-imposed walls. Sergei wishes he could reach him, to help in some way, but Strahd remains distant. Still, he assures himself—perhaps too forcefully—that his brother has given his blessing for this union and will stand by his side today. But Sally senses a crack in the conviction of his words. Something feels off. Strahd’s approval may not be as certain as Sergei wants to believe.

Sergei’s gaze once again finds Ireena, his curiosity piqued. The resemblance to Tatyana is undeniable. Ireena offers a careful answer—she is a distant cousin of Tatyana’s. Sergei brightens at the thought of meeting more of his future family, his warm demeanor returning.

Ireena shifts the conversation, asking if he is nervous about the ceremony. Sergei hesitates before admitting the truth. He is marrying the woman of his dreams, but today is also one of the hardest days of his life. He confesses, almost to himself, that he is beginning this marriage with a lie, and that before the day is over, he must speak with both Strahd and Tatyana. But the weight of this revelation pulls him inward, his expression turning pensive. Sensing the shift, Sally deftly changes the topic, asking about the Rozanas of the land.

Sergei responds with what little he knows—they are ancient deities, once worshipped by the native people before Strahd’s conquest. Beyond that, his knowledge is limited, but he does add one intriguing detail: Strahd, for reasons unknown, has shown great interest in them.

His attention drifts back to Ireena, studying her with quiet fascination. There is something profoundly familiar about her, though he cannot place it. With a soft smile, he shares a sentiment—she reminds him of Tatyana. Tatyana, he says, is strong, made of fire and riverstone. And in Ireena, he sees that same unyielding strength.

Ireena, now watching him closely, asks what he intends to offer Tatyana. Sergei, both bashful and proud, speaks from the heart. He wishes to learn from her, to teach her in turn—on how to wield a rapier. He wants to spend his life proving to himself that he is worthy of her. More than anything, he longs to leave this place behind, to build a quiet life with Tatyana in a cottage at the base of the mountain. The ambitions that once seemed so important to him now pale in comparison to what truly matters—her happiness.

As he speaks, lost in the intensity of his words, his hand comes to rest lightly on Ireena’s shoulder. They smile at one another, a shared moment passing between them. Sally senses that Ireena is on the verge of saying something, something weighty—but at the last moment, she holds it back.

The tolling of the bells shatters the moment. Sergei startles, remembering where he is, and apologizes—his wedding is about to begin. As he turns to leave, Sally reaches out, gripping his hand. Lowering her voice so that Ireena cannot hear, she makes an unusual request: she asks Sergei to give Ireena a hug. Ireena, she explains, has lost the man she loved, and Sergei reminds her of him.

Sergei hesitates, caught off guard by the request, but ultimately relents. He steps toward Ireena and embraces her. Ireena, in turn, melts into the embrace, as though she has been holding her breath for far too long. The hug lingers, stretching past the bounds of propriety, and Ireena’s shoulders tremble as quiet tears slip down her face. Sergei, gentle and reassuring, tells her that though she has lost the man she loved, he will always be with her, never truly gone.

Reality reasserts itself. Sergei blinks, his mind returning to the present. He releases her, apologizing once more before making his way toward the chapel.

Sally watches as Ireena’s expression hardens. The sorrow lingers, but beneath it, something else stirs—fury at the life stolen from her, at the happiness that should have been hers. Determination ignites in her gaze. She will break the cycle. She will find Sergei again, no matter what it takes. She will end this curse.

Without a word, Sally shifts into the form of a blue monarch butterfly and flutters away, seeking Tatyana’s chambers.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the wedding preparations unfold, Tian moves through the chapel, scanning for hidden weapons or signs of an ambush. His sharp eyes sweep the area, his movements careful and deliberate. While maneuvering through the space, he spots Alek Gwillym, newly returned from Argynvostholt, engaged in conversation with a guard. Tian subtly makes his way closer, straining to catch snippets of their exchange.

He manages to overhear two things: 

* Alek mentions the need to report to Strahd.   
* She is informed that Rahadin has reassigned a guard to secure a corridor, though Alek appears perplexed by the decision.

Sensing the importance of this information, Tian follows her as she makes her way to an audience with Strahd. Concealing himself in the shadows, he listens as she delivers her report.

She confirms that the rumors about Argynvostholt are true. The ruins still harbor unnatural beings—ghosts, revenants, and other undead creatures. Though the Order of the Silver Dragon is shattered, it has not been laid to rest. Alek continues, revealing that Commander Hornguard has returned as a revenant and has awakened his fallen soldiers as well.

Strahd absorbs the information in silence before finally speaking. He acknowledges the presence of these spirits but states that he has plans for the ruins. A solution must be found for their new inhabitants. Alek then raises concerns about the palace’s security, but Strahd remains unconcerned. Rahadin has already arranged the defenses, and Strahd does not believe *"he"* will be foolish enough to make a move today. When Alek offers to strengthen his security detail, Strahd firmly declines, ordering her instead to focus on the safety of the guests. He has more than enough protection of his own. Dismissed, Alek bows and takes her leave.

With the conversation concluded, Tian resumes his surveillance, his gaze sweeping the hall. His attention is drawn to a strikingly beautiful woman, effortlessly charming the guests before making her way toward him. She takes his hand and leads him into a dance, speaking in hushed tones. The moment she speaks, Tian recognizes her—Ezmeralda, disguised by magic to blend in among the guests.

As they move across the floor, she discreetly shares her findings. Some of the guards wear scarves with a subtle but distinct green pattern, different from the rest. She suspects they are enemy soldiers in disguise. Lowering her voice further, she hints at even more significant discoveries and suggests they reconvene with the group to discuss. Before departing, Ezmeralda catches sight of Strahd striding away with purpose. Without hesitation, she slips from Tian’s grasp and follows after him.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meanwhile, after speaking with Andral, Ziva returns to the chapel in search of Leo Dilisnya. She finds him engaged in conversation with a cluster of nobles, his presence distinct in a finely tailored grey ensemble—an unusual choice, as grey is typically worn at funerals. As she approaches, their eyes meet, and Leo greets Ziva as a fellow guest. 

They talk for a while, exchanging pleasantries, and Leo does little to hide his distaste for Strahd.

Pressed further, he admits that there was once a time when he respected Strahd, back before he became an army commander and inherited his father’s war. But that time has long passed. Now, he sees Strahd as a failed king, a sentiment he voices without hesitation. Yet, with a practiced smoothness, he tempers his words, acknowledging that his relationship with Strahd remains… complicated.

Ziva steers the discussion toward Patrina and Rahadin, observing Leo’s reaction closely. His expression darkens with barely concealed disgust at their presence among the nobility. When he turns the question back on her, asking what she thinks of the wedding, she feigns disinterest, calling it dull. But events like these, she muses, have a way of revealing both the best and worst in people. She wouldn’t be surprised if a scandal broke out before the night was over—or if blood were spilled.

Leo tenses at her words, his guarded demeanor shifting subtly. He is not foolish enough to implicate himself in any potential violence, and his silence speaks volumes. Before she can push further, movement at the edge of her vision catches her attention. Strahd strides purposefully away, his focus singular. Recognizing the significance of his departure, Ziva offers a polite farewell to Leo and follows after Strahd, her curiosity piqued.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sally, now a delicate blue monarch butterfly, flutters through the corridors in search of Tatyana’s room. It takes time, but eventually, she finds it and slips inside. Tatyana sits before a mirror, anxiously brushing her hair, a nervous energy lingering in the air.

Sally lands gently on the fabric of Tatyana’s dress. The young woman notices her and, mistaking her for a lucky charm, smiles softly. She begins speaking, as if simply voicing her thoughts to the tiny creature. She admits to restless nights, her sleep troubled by strange dreams. Last night, she dreamed of falling—plunging endlessly through darkness, never reaching the ground.

As she speaks, Sally flutters into Tatyana’s hair. Though briefly startled, Tatyana welcomes the butterfly’s presence, as if drawing comfort from the tiny creature’s attention.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Milos sits in the courtyard, basking in the rare warmth of the sun against his skin, when his attention is drawn to a quiet exchange nearby. Sergei and Andral stand together, speaking in hushed tones, but Milos catches only a single fragment of their conversation—Sergei’s voice rising slightly as he insists, *“I know you’re disappointed in me, but it’s what I had to do.”*

A tense pause follows before Sergei continues, saying he needs to speak with Strahd. Without another word, he turns and strides toward the castle.

Milos pushes himself up and follows.

Inside, Sergei moves through the corridors with purpose until he reaches a door, its surface adorned with intricate embellishments. A small plaque beside it reads: **Trophy Room.**

Milos slips into the room, moving soundlessly along the walls with vampiric grace. Outside, Ziva and Ezmeralda linger near the door, straining to catch every word.

Inside, Sergei finds Strahd standing by the window, his gaze fixed on the festivities below. The revelry unfolds beneath him, but his expression remains unreadable.

Sergei steps forward, his frustration evident as he questions why Strahd has been avoiding him. Three days have passed, and Strahd has yet to truly look at him.

With his usual composed demeanor, Strahd dismisses the concern, claiming to be busy and insisting there is nothing more to it. But Sergei does not relent. He presses Strahd for an explanation, demanding to know the true meaning behind the blessing he was given.

Strahd responds coolly—Sergei should be happy. He has been granted permission to marry, and today, after all, is his wedding day.

But Sergei does not accept the evasion. He pushes further, and for the first time, Strahd’s facade cracks, if only slightly. There is a flicker of something—regret, resentment—before he speaks again. Sergei had his youth. He was free to live, to experience the world, while Strahd was left to fight their father’s wars.

Sergei counters, his voice insistent. He tried to find Strahd, to fight at his side, but no matter how hard he searched, he could never reach him.

A shadow passes over Strahd’s face, but the moment is fleeting. When he responds, his tone is hollow, distant—Sergei must not have tried hard enough.

He moves to the heart of the matter. He gave Sergei a choice: his vows as Dawnmaster or Tatyana. He wanted to see if Sergei would hesitate, if duty might outweigh sentiment. But there was no hesitation. Sergei chose Tatyana without a second thought. Strahd never had that luxury. He was never given a choice—only duty, only responsibility.

At this, Sergei softens. He steps closer, his voice quiet, almost pleading. If it meant having a real relationship with his brother, he would give Tatyana up. He does not want to lose Strahd. Whatever burden Strahd carries, they could bear it together. He has always looked up to him.

Strahd stiffens, bristling at the words. His voice turns cold, laced with bitterness. Love is a luxury for men who have not bled. Sergei has his blessing, but he will never have his heart—because there is nothing left of it.

And yet, beneath the resentment, there is something else. A reluctant admission. Sergei is a good man, and he deserves happiness. But happiness comes with a price, and Sergei’s own happiness has destroyed Strahd.

With that, Strahd turns away, his presence vanishing like a specter before he strides from the room.

Sergei lingers a moment longer, his expression unreadable. He wipes his eyes, composes himself, and then quietly follows suit.

Ziva and Milos follow Strahd, catching up to him under the pretense of offering their congratulations on his brother’s wedding. His expression is vacant, his gaze distant, as if he is looking through them rather than at them. But the moment passes, and with practiced ease, he slips on a mask of polite composure.

His attention shifts to Milos. There is a flicker of recognition—not of the man himself, but of something deeper. Strahd sees in him the look of someone who has met death and emerged unbroken.

Before the conversation can unfold further, Arabelle joins them, having lingered in the courtyard to play with the other children. Strahd’s carefully maintained mask falters when he sees her. He lowers himself to her level, smiling, though his eyes search hers with quiet curiosity. There is wisdom there, far beyond her years. He wonders what those young eyes have seen.

Arabelle’s own smile fades. A flicker of uncertainty passes over her face, fear creeping in at the edges. Without a word, she presses closer to Ziva, who instinctively wraps an arm around her.

Ziva redirects the conversation, offering a passing compliment on the stained glass above the chapel entrance, calling it a generous gift. Strahd merely counters that it was a show of faith for the newlyweds.

When the subject turns to the bride, his mask does not crack. He speaks of Tatyana with detached ease, stating that she has been a member of the court for some time now and that he knows her well enough. He admits to granting his brother permission to marry her, despite the fact that Sergei’s station required him to remain celibate. There is no emotion in his words, no hesitation.

The conversation shifts once more, this time to faith. Strahd studies them both, his interest measured, before posing a question—what does faith mean to them?

Ziva answers first. To her, faith is personal, unique to every individual. Just as no one can dictate how to find or manage faith, neither can she impose her own beliefs on another. The gods do not exist to solve her problems; her struggles are her own, and she must face them herself. But she takes comfort in knowing she is never truly alone—her faith offers guidance, a source of unwavering support.

Milos, however, takes a different view. Faith, to him, is a tool—something to wield, something that makes him stronger.

Strahd muses on their answers before offering his own. He is not a man of faith, though he once tolerated the church out of respect for his late mother. Ultimately, he believes religion is little more than a means of control. The world is not fair, and faith has never been a luxury afforded to him.

For him, a man’s worth—his legacy—is measured by the sacrifices he makes, the burdens he shoulders so that others do not have to. Faith and hope, he concludes, are the refuge of fools too blind to see the world as it truly is.

With that, the conversation draws to an end. Ziva, Arabelle, and Milos take their leave, stepping away from Strahd’s shadow to rejoin the others.

In the chapel hall, Tian keeps a close eye on the crowd and quickly notices Rahadin watching Leo from time to time, as though expecting him to act out of line. Leo, regales the surrounding nobles with jokes. But as Tian observes more carefully, he catches a glimpse beneath Leo’s finely tailored grey cloak—a green armband, identical to those worn by the misplaced guards. Leo may play the careless noble, but he is clearly a calculated man, careful with both his actions and words.

Elsewhere, Milos quietly makes his way through the corridors, checking if the grand tapestry depicting King Barov wielding the Brightblade still hangs in its familiar place. It does, though it is in far better condition than the faded and worn version that remains in the present. As he scans the room, his eyes land on Arabelle standing near the edge, speaking quietly with an elderly woman. Ireena is nowhere to be seen.

Ziva, also searching for Arabelle, spots her in the same corner. As her gaze sharpens on the older woman, she is startled to recognize a younger, though still blind, Madame Eva. She approaches, arriving at the same time as Milos. Arabelle rises to greet them and immediately makes Ziva promise not to harm Eva, explaining that the seer is part of the vision in a peculiar way.

When Ziva offers a cold introduction for herself and Milos, Eva acknowledges them both, revealing that she already knows who they are. She has come to this vision to witness a pivotal moment—the turning of the tide, the instant everything became sealed and countless undeserving souls were trapped in time. Turning toward Ziva, Eva remarks on the anger she senses from her.

Ziva gives a short laugh, insisting that “anger” is an understatement. She suggests that Eva, as a powerful seer, should already understand the source of her pain. Eva begins to weep softly and admits that she does not yet know what she has done to cause such suffering, but she offers an apology nonetheless. Ziva acknowledges the apology without accepting it and sharply demands to know how Eva can still be alive, given that the events of this vision occurred over four centuries ago.

Eva replies that time flows differently for her—as it does for Ziva, whether she realizes it or not. Her perception of time, her age, and her purpose are all tied to Strahd by choice. If Strahd were to vanish, so too would those ties, though her sight and power would remain. She tells Ziva that there is still much she can learn.

While the conversation continues, Milos spots Ireena in the crowd. She has tied her hair up, hiding her resemblance to Tatyana, and strides boldly toward Strahd. Without a word, he excuses himself and follows, intent on listening in.

Back by Eva’s side, Ziva questions the old woman’s interest in Arabelle. Eva answers with surprising sincerity: she wants Arabelle to be prepared. It was difficult for her once—it still is—and she hopes to spare the girl from the same pain. A time will come when Arabelle must make critical choices, and Eva wants her to choose freely, to forge her own path.

Ziva then asks what Eva would be willing to do to break the curse that grips Barovia. Eva offers a sorrowful smile and responds with the answer Ziva wishes to hear, though she admits the truth is more complex. She would do whatever it takes—not to end Strahd’s curse, but to free the people trapped here, so they may shape their own destinies. She tells Ziva that she accepts her hatred willingly, if it means Ziva can move forward and make her own choices.

Ziva gives a terse farewell and turns to leave, but Eva offers one final warning: not to stand in the way of Arabelle’s choices.

Milos drifts closer to Ireena and Strahd, positioning himself to overhear their exchange without drawing attention. Ireena approaches Strahd with boldness, speaking cryptically about events that have yet to happen, unsettling him. She wonders aloud if he is truly the hero of legend. Strahd, clearly perplexed by her words, responds with bitterness. He speaks of the sacrifices he has made for this land—of the blood he has shed and the ash he has received in return. He insists that someone must rule, and he will not allow Barovia to fall into weak hands. Though he wishes things had been different, he claims that this land respects only strength.

At her mention of love and joy, Strahd steps closer, his tone strange as he notes that Ireena remembers things she should not. He asks her who she truly is. Ireena turns to leave but pauses just long enough to answer: she is someone who wishes to see how this all ends. With that, she walks away.

Milos intercepts her as she departs, quietly asking if the conversation brought her any peace. She replies that it did not, but it was something she needed to do. Her hatred for Strahd remains, but she is drawn to understanding how everything came to be as it is.

Their conversation shifts naturally, landing on the subject of Milos’s vampirism. He confesses that he never wanted this existence and has no intention of living as a creature of the night. Ireena asks if he would accept a cure, should one ever become possible. Milos admits he would—he does not wish to live this way.

In the stillness before the vision ends, Ireena invites him to dance. As they move together, Milos confesses his love for her. The words stun her into silence. She looks at him, at the way he smiles, and murmurs that she remembers a time when he used to smile like that.

Meanwhile, Ziva finds Arabelle and gently inquires about her reaction earlier—when Strahd spoke and Arabelle froze before hiding behind her. Arabelle reveals that she saw memories from Strahd’s perspective, visions she cannot bring herself to speak of just yet. 

Ziva assures Arabelle that she will always be there whenever Arabelle feels ready to talk. Arabelle offers a quick thank-you, then shifts the conversation. She asks whether, if she were to stop traveling with the party, they would still visit her. Ziva responds without hesitation, affirming that they would.

This leads Arabelle to wonder aloud whether Milos might leave Moonshade to stay with her. Ziva considers the idea and admits it’s possible. She agrees with Arabelle's sentiment—that Milos can be both incredibly frustrating and unexpectedly kind.

At this, Arabelle presses further, asking what Ziva’s connection with Milos truly is. Ziva tries to deflect the question, but ultimately admits that she likes him as a person. Still, she insists that she holds no romantic feelings for him.

With that, they rejoin the group in the chapel hall, at about the same time that Ireena and Milos do.

As the party regathers in the chapel, they exchange information, sharing what each of them has uncovered. The conversation is brief, their voices hushed beneath the towering stained glass windows. Before they can fully piece their findings together, a servant approaches, requesting a moment of their time. The bride has summoned them—she wishes to speak with them before the ceremony. Even now, she waits.

As the party turns to follow, a crack ripples through the vision—darkness unfurling from Strahd like a silent wave. None of the other guests seem to notice. Then, a chilling chorus of voices begins to whisper through the hall: *“Sacrifice. Sacrifice. Sacrifice. Until when, lord? It is coming to pass. Everything you love will die. Same as you. Wither and decay…”*

The party looks toward Strahd and sees his jaw tighten. He sharply turns his head away, gaze fixed on the people in the hall. It becomes clear that the whispers of the Dark Powers reach only his ears.

The page boy leads the party to Tatyana’s room.

Inside, Tatyana sings softly to herself, trying to soothe her nerves. When the party enters, she thanks them for coming, her gaze lingering on Ireena just a moment longer than the rest. She explains that they are not truly strangers—she has seen each of them in her dreams. Though it sounds strange, she feels as if she knows them. Something deep within tells her she needed to speak with them, even if she cannot explain why.

This moment stands outside the vision. It is not memory—it is Ireena’s soul reaching out.

Tatyana shares that she was raised as a servant, but everything changed when she met Sergei. He saw her—truly saw her—for who she was. When he looks at her, she feels pure joy. She is happy and deeply grateful to be marrying him today, yet she cannot shake the sense that it will end in tragedy.

When Milos inquires about Strahd’s behavior, she admits she does not believe he genuinely supports the wedding. Though Strahd gave Sergei his blessing, it felt hollow. She confesses that she once admired him—and perhaps a part of her still does. But he never lets anyone in. On rare occasions, she glimpsed something beneath his guarded exterior, but he always buried it again behind walls.

Despite everything, she does not believe Strahd will actively stop the wedding. She still does not understand why she called the party here—only that she felt she had to.

She speaks of other dreams, especially one of her grandmother, who told her stories of the Rozanas and gifted her the pendant she now holds. A strange sense of déjà vu clings to her. She met with Eva earlier as well, who spoke cryptically but advised her to smile at every moment she can.

Milos gently takes the pendant from her and places it into Ireena’s hand. It pulses in response. Ireena steps forward and returns the pendant to Tatyana, then quietly asks what memory she holds dearest.

Tatyana smiles, her eyes distant, and speaks of the river, her first horse, Sergei’s hands when he proposed—moments that warm her soul and bring a smile to her face.

Then, Ireena removes her disguise. Tatyana falls silent in stunned recognition. Ireena reveals the truth: they are the same. Tatyana smiles sadly and says she already knew. She reaches out, taking Ireena’s hands in her own.

The vision begins to collapse inward, folding around them. Scenes of Tatyana’s life flood the space—memories of everything she loved, cherished, and held close to her heart. The party glimpses only fleeting fragments. Ireena, however, sees it all.

When the vision stabilizes once more, both women are crying.

Tatyana speaks to Ireena, her voice full of warmth and sorrow. She says she always hoped someone would remember. Ireena is not her, not entirely—she carries Tatyana’s soul, but also a strength all her own.

Tatyana knows what is coming. She knows this is the end. In this fleeting moment, the party is her last company. She asks Ireena to walk her down the aisle—not toward the end, but toward a beginning. Ireena, through tears, agrees.

With that, they prepare to descend.

As the party prepares, the chapel bell tolls again, signaling the beginning of the ceremony. Sergei enters through a side door and ascends toward the altar. Sally, once again shifting into a butterfly, lands gently on his coat. Sergei notices the butterfly and, taking it as a sign that Lathander has not forgotten him, offers a quiet word of gratitude to his god.

The party arrives shortly after and takes their place among the gathered guests. As they settle in, another dark ripple emanates from Strahd, followed by the dissonant chorus of voices: *“Blessed, behold the son. Save him and lose her. You choose… Control. Take what’s yours.”* Strahd mutters to himself, barely audible: *“No. I do not need you.”* The guards nearby shift uneasily as Elona, the young priestess, steps onto the dais to officiate.

Music begins to play. At the entrance, Tatyana and Ireena appear, walking arm in arm. They smile through tears, a mirror of one another, and approach the altar together. When Sergei catches sight of them, his own eyes well with tears, his joy radiating through the chapel.

Tatyana takes her place beside Sergei as Elona begins the ceremony. She addresses Tatyana by her full name and newly granted title: *Tatyana Fendorana, Flame of the Riverland.* Vows are exchanged—words of love, promises of unity and unwavering support until the end of their days.

Throughout the proceedings, Strahd remains frozen, a statue in the crowd. His expression is unreadable, his jaw clenched, his hands balled into fists. When Elona turns to him for a blessing, he offers only a nod, lips pressed tightly shut.

Tatyana and Sergei share a ceremonial cup of wine. With this act, Elona pronounces them bound for life. She then invites the guests to offer words to the newlyweds, directing her gaze toward Strahd. As lord of the land, his voice should be the first. But Strahd remains silent.

Andral steps in, lightening the moment with humor as he rescues Strahd from the discomfort of public speaking. He wishes the young couple a life filled with light and happiness, offering his heartfelt congratulations. The chapel erupts in cheers and applause.

The atmosphere changes instantly when Leo Dilisnya rises, mockingly clapping. His speech begins with veiled jabs, but soon takes on a sinister tone: *“Love. Such a noble thing. How lucky we are to see it bloom amidst such decay. To House Zarovich. May its roots rot in the blood it has spilt.”*

Confusion ripples through the crowd. The party hears the unmistakable sound of crossbows drawn taut—and in the next moment, a storm of bolts rains down from hidden alcoves and rafters, targeting Strahd, Sergei, and Tatyana.

Without hesitation, Strahd teleports in front of the couple, casting a shimmering arcane shield to protect Tatyana. He throws himself toward Sergei, trying to block the oncoming assault. But the arrows meant for Strahd strike Sergei instead. Sergei collapses, bolts lodged in his shoulder and gut.

Behind them, Elona falls down the dais steps, her lifeless eyes staring upward—one of the first to fall in the ambush.

The Shards of Dawn spring into action. Tian closes the distance to Leo and delivers a flurry of strikes, seeking justice though knowing Leo’s true death lies elsewhere. Milos rushes toward one of the hidden shooters, his weapon already drawn as chaos erupts.

Panicked guests scramble in every direction as more assassins, disguised as attendees, draw poisoned daggers and lash out into the crowd. Ireena leaps onto the altar, pushing toward Tatyana and Sergei, desperate to help.

A thunderous explosion follows as Ezmeralda eliminates a cluster of assassins, drawing her crossbow and rapier in one fluid motion, ready to defend those around her.

As the violence continues, the air begins to shift. The winds stir, moving in an ancient, rhythmic cadence. Sally hears nature’s call deep in her bones—a warning. Patrina, unaffected by the mayhem, is already on the move, slipping away from the room unnoticed by most.

Sally sheds her butterfly form and signals to Milos. Without hesitation, they break from the fray and sprint after Patrina, vanishing through the doors as the chaos behind them surges.

Meanwhile, near the altar, as Sergei collapses to the ground, Strahd quickly traces an arcane sigil in the air. A shimmering bubble expands around him and his fallen brother, its surface pulsing with magical energy. But even as the shield forms, the guards drag Tatyana away—snatching her from the sanctuary’s protection.

Within the dome, time slows until it halts entirely. The effects of the **Time Stop** spell settle over the space like a frozen dream, though the party alone perceives what transpires inside.

Strahd turns to Sergei, whose body is riddled with bolts. Though still alive, Sergei’s breaths are shallow, his lifeblood pooling beneath him. Strahd raises a hand, arcane light beginning to swell within his palm. The glow turns white-hot with healing intent as he prepares to restore his brother’s life.

But the darkness within him pulses again, rippling outward like a tide. The voices return, relentless and cruel: *“So the loyal son kneels once more, believing mercy can buy salvation. Last time you did this, it was the body of somebody you loved. Tell us, has the road been kind, lord?”*

Strahd tries to resist, insisting he has endured worse, but the voices crescendo, drowning out his thoughts: *“You held a sword, while he held the sun. He will die a hero and you will die forgotten.”*

He protests again—he can still save Sergei, if only he can stabilize him long enough for a cleric to intervene. The voices press harder: *“Save him and lose her… again. She follows him, always. You chase, she flees, always going after him. We have seen it. Every time… every time. Without him, the path clears. She’ll need you. In time, all bends. And what is my gift, if not time? Kill him and I will grant you a thousand lives, endless nights, and power beyond comprehension. You will be young and strong, and you will have a chance at happiness with her.”*

Strahd remembers the wars he won, the empire he secured—and how it was Sergei who captured the hearts of the people. Everything had been given to Sergei. And now, even as he dies, he looks to Strahd for salvation.

The Dark Powers, led by Vampyr, urge Strahd toward selfishness, toward dominion: *“Then stop saving, lord. Start to take. Start to take, for yourself.”*

Strahd whispers a final protest—he will not trade blood for love, not again. But Vampyr’s response is chilling: *“We are not offering blood. We are offering control. He had her, he tasted it, and he did not appreciate it—not like you. Take what is yours.”*

Strahd looks down at Sergei one final time. His brother’s hands still clutch the symbol of Lathander. With trembling fingers, Strahd gently places those hands over Sergei’s chest. His voice is barely audible as he chokes back tears.

*“You are a better man than I am.”*

He turns the holy symbol toward Sergei’s heart and begins to push it inward, slow and deliberate. It sinks in halfway. Milos, watching from beyond the dome, notices that the symbol Sergei bears matches his own—the same holy emblem, incomplete without the other half.

Strahd opens his mouth. His teeth remain human—no sign yet of the monster he will become. He lowers his lips to Sergei’s neck and drinks.

The blood flows, and for the first time, the whispers go silent.

Time resumes. The dome dissipates.

Sergei lies lifeless at Strahd’s feet. Across the room, Tatyana is still being dragged away, but her eyes are locked on her husband’s body—and on the man who has taken everything from her. Horror twists across her face.

Strahd rises. His expression is not triumphant, but haunted. He looks at Tatyana. She is alive. And for a brief, damning moment—he believes the lie.

As chaos unfolds in the chapel, Milos and Sally follow Patrina down a corridor deeper into the castle.

Strahd drops Sergei to the ground. Angry and wounded, he charges after Tatyana, who is being ushered out by the guards.

Ziva scans the scene, taking in the movements of the key players. She spots Rahadin, who watches Strahd closely, prioritizing the lord's safety while trying to protect as many guests as possible.

She sees Alek amidst the fray, organizing the guards and battling fiercely to eliminate the threat of the archers above.

Glancing toward the bench where she last saw Eva, Ziva notes the old woman remains seated, observing the unfolding catastrophe.

Turning her attention to Countess Dorfniya’s last known position, Ziva witnesses the aftermath of a skirmish. Balverzi assassins had attempted to extract the countess, but guards loyal to Strahd overwhelmed them, killing Dorfniya as she tried to escape.

Across the room, Andral calls for his weapon. Once handed his warhammer, he charges toward Sergei's body.

Ireena tries to push through the chaos toward Tatyana, but Balverzi assassins block her path. Her training takes over; she ducks and sidesteps their attacks, pressing forward with determination.

A violent explosion rocks the upper balconies. From the resulting blaze, Ezmeralda leaps down onto the main floor, having dispatched several archers. Without missing a beat, she fires her crossbow, striking an assassin between the eyes, then quickly casts **Darkness** to obscure one of the passages, slowing the flow of enemy reinforcements.

Meanwhile, Tian fells an assassin with a flurry of precise punches.

Ziva and Arabelle make their way toward the altar, where Sergei now lies lifeless.

Both Ziva and Andral arrive at the altar simultaneously. Andral attempts to heal Sergei, but halts when he realizes the young man is beyond saving. His gaze falls upon the holy symbol embedded in Sergei’s chest. Having seen Strahd kneeling beside Sergei moments before, Andral’s disbelief swiftly turns to grim understanding.

Ziva closes Sergei’s eyes and murmurs a prayer over him. She then carefully removes the broken half of the holy symbol that remains outside his chest.

Seeing no further aid she can offer at the altar, Ziva retrieves the box of bones taken from Lady Wachter from her Bag of Holding. She opens it and casts **Locate Object** on the remains, seeking confirmation that they belong to Leo Dilisnya. When the bones glow in response, her suspicion is confirmed.

Elsewhere, Ireena finally reaches Tatyana, just as an assassin casts **Silence** in an attempt to disrupt Strahd’s spellcasting.

Strahd, enraged, shrugs off the effects of the **Silence** spell and conjures a **Wall of Fire**, creating a burning tunnel toward the door through which Tatyana had been taken.

Cut off by the towering flames, Ziva and Arabelle abandon the altar and decide to pursue Milos and Sally in hopes of dealing with Patrina.

Milos and Sally race after Patrina, but soon lose sight of her as she descends deeper into the castle, moving toward the dungeons.

Unable to see her anymore, Sally casts **Detect Magic** and successfully identifies the lingering trace of her passage.

Following the magical tether, Sally leads the way through a massive, dark doorway.

Beyond the threshold, Sally and Milos enter an enormous cavernous chamber, the walls and floors sculpted from gleaming black obsidian.

In this chamber they see three obsidian pillars rising from pools of crackling nature magic. The pillars converge at their peaks to form a three-sided pyramid, suspended impossibly in the air. At the base of each pillar, a pool of nature magic pulses with energy, each depicting a miniature landscape: 

* a rocky, jagged terrain with scattered mountains;  
* a grassy, flowered glade deep within a forest, that Sally recognizes as the area behind the Bonegrinder Mill;  
* a murky, swamp-infested region.

Nestled within the center of the pyramid, hundreds of small red crystals drift in an unseen current, slowly swirling into the rough outline of a heart.

As Sally and Milos step further into the chamber, they catch sight of Patrina, her voice weaving the final words of a powerful incantation. Her eyes roll back as she declares, *"Now is the time. Now all that death above can fuel this."* Tendrils of black smoke rise from her outstretched hands, siphoning the death and chaos from above and channeling it into the forming crystal heart. The crystals begin to thrum with a deep, resonant pulse.

A sudden, oppressive sensation washes over Sally—a feeling of chains tightening, of nature rotting and dread seeping into her very being.

Noticing their arrival, Patrina casts a disdainful glance at Milos and Sally, dismissing them even as she welcomes their challenge. Without hesitation, Milos sprints up the wall, launching himself at Patrina and striking a devastating blow. Even as he lands the attack, an unsettling sense of darkness surrounding the ritual gnaws at his instincts.

Patrina, unfazed by the wound, laughs and declares, *"It’s already too late. I’m saving him. The moment he made his choice, the land changed."*

Sally moves closer to the pyramid, examining the structure. The dark, glossy material of the pillars feels unnatural—something she has seen before, deep within the crypts near the village of Barovia where the Shards of Dawn uncovered the Bloodstone. The red crystals hum with gathering power, and a faint whisper drifts from the forming heart, as if the crystals are awakening.

Patrina, seemingly unconcerned by the fight, continues speaking. She explains that Strahd was never meant to die; his fate had been sealed long before the events unfolding above. She expresses a preference for conversation over combat.

Sally and Milos press her for answers, asking if she had made her own pact with the Dark Powers. Patrina denies this, though she admits that Strahd had already made himself into a god long before accepting the Dark Powers' gifts.

She elaborates further, revealing that once, long ago, three deities known as the Rozanas had watched over this realm. Sisters, revered and powerful, the Rozanas had been forgotten when Strahd brought his father's war to these lands, buried under bloodshed and ruin. Strahd, with Patrina's help, had reshaped them—assimilating their essence and restoring their influence in a new, darker form. Patrina claims her loyalty lies with Strahd, believing him to be a catalyst and a visionary for change.

When Sally asks whether Lysaga had any involvement, Patrina dismisses the old witch with a wave, clearly uninterested. Lysaga, she claims, had no part in these events.

At that moment, Ziva and Arabelle arrive, stepping into the obsidian chamber to join their companions.

Milos notices that the light infusing the forming crystal heart shares the same deep, unnatural hue as the Bloodstone.

The fight against Patrina resumes. As Ziva attempts to cast **Guiding Bolt**, the pendant once belonging to Villeneuve absorbs the spell and detonates in a sudden wave of chaotic magic. The backlash grants Ziva the effects of **Feather Fall**.

Seizing the opportunity, Sally casts **Hold Person** and successfully paralyzes Patrina. Milos, wasting no time, takes advantage of Patrina’s restrained state and cleaves her in two with his sword. However, Patrina was not meant to die here and since the vision cannot change events that have already happened, only show them, so at the moment of death, her character dissipates into ethereal mist.

Determined to investigate the forming heart, Milos lifts Sally and Ziva and carries them up to where the heart floats, held aloft by unseen forces. The crystals have multiplied, their numbers growing with each passing moment. The heart beats in rhythm with strange, mechanical whispers that fill the chamber.

Sally reaches out and touches the heart. Instantly, the voices of the Ladies Three speak to her through the structure. Their power feels twisted, corrupted; nature itself seems to be dying as the heart siphons the remnants of the Ladies' strength. Yet Sally realizes with a sinking feeling that the energy sustaining the heart no longer belongs to them—it has been stolen.

The heart pulses violently, releasing a wave of necrotic energy that strikes all three of them. Sally and Milos are thrown back to the ground, while Ziva, still under the lingering effects of chaos magic, floats unharmed.

Recovering quickly, Ziva begins to inspect the area more closely. Around the bases of the obsidian pillars, she finds rune markings—ancient designs crafted to siphon energy from one source and transfer it to another. As realization dawns, horror follows: the pillars are draining the divine energy from the Ladies Three, ripping their natural magic away and funneling it into Strahd.

Piecing the evidence together, Ziva concludes that Strahd must have found and desecrated the shrines at each fane, linking their sacred energies into this infernal device. He is the Land, not only in spirit but through control of the very forces that once resisted him.

She recalls the vision of Strahd’s battle with Markovia, where the stake meant to end him was deflected by a shield of red energy. That same red resonance had pulsed from deep within Castle Ravenloft—energy that now binds these crystals into a forming heart.

As the heart’s beat grows louder, Ziva realizes a grim truth: this heart, though formidable now, is still in its infancy. In the present day, it will have matured into something far stronger, far more dangerous.

Ziva theorizes that the heart consumes vast amounts of energy and that the Shards of Dawn could disrupt Strahd’s entire scheme by removing the heart from the equation. Yet she has no idea how such a feat could be accomplished.

She shares her findings and theories with Milos, Sally, and Arabelle, and together the party ascends once more, leaving the dark heart behind—for now.

While Milos, Sally, Ziva, and Arabelle confront the obsidian heart, Tian remains behind, engaged in battle against the assassins swarming around Strahd.

Strahd grows increasingly furious as the delays mount, preventing him from reaching Tatyana. Rahadin, now fighting at Strahd’s side, mutters that he expected Leo would attempt something like this. In response, Strahd promises Rahadin that they will find Leo—and kill him.

Desperate to advance, Strahd draws more heavily upon the esoteric magic of the Land, channeling its corrupted power to force his way forward.

As the party reunites, they take a quick survey of the battlefield. Rahadin is at Strahd’s side, but there is no sign of Andral or Alek. The floor is littered with bodies, the assassins gaining more ground with every moment. Being closest to him, Tian senses a pulse of rage from Strahd, noting with unease that something about him already feels changed.

Pressing onward, the group reaches a more fortified wing of the castle. Within one of the chambers, they find Ireena and Tatyana, both surrounded by guards. Tatyana stands pale and trembling, paralyzed by shock. Strahd calls out to her, but she does not react.

He orders the guards to leave them. Once the room is emptied, Tatyana slowly lifts her gaze. Seeing Strahd, she breaks into a panicked sprint and throws herself into his arms. Strahd embraces her gently, his touch almost tender.

He then asks her about Sergei. When Tatyana falters, Strahd answers for her, his voice heavy with false sorrow: he was with Sergei, he says. Sergei died quickly. He tried to shield him, even to give his own life for Sergei’s, but fate chose otherwise.

Hearing this, Tatyana crumbles further, sobs wracking her fragile form. Strahd continues, weaving his lie: he held Sergei in his final moments, and Sergei’s last word was Tatyana’s name. There is nothing left in that room but death and ashes.

He urges her to survive, promising to take her to safety. Tatyana, shattered and desperate, nods and takes his hand, allowing him to lead her away.

Together, they ascend toward the upper spires of the castle. Tatyana walks beside Strahd, her body moving but her mind seemingly elsewhere, her gaze vacant.

As they climb higher, they encounter a contingent of guards. Relief crosses their faces when they see Strahd; they report that they had been searching for him. Strahd coldly orders them downstairs.

The guards hesitate, protesting that they had been assigned by Alek to personally guard him. Hearing this, Strahd’s fury explodes. With inhuman speed, he slaughters all those who hesitate to obey.

The remaining guards stare in horror. Strahd kneels beside one of the corpses and reveals a green armband—a sign that the guard had been an assassin. Yet of the ten men he killed, only two wear the green band. The rest had been loyal.

Amidst the carnage, Tian approaches and informs Strahd that Patrina’s task is complete. Strahd barely registers the information, uninterested and focused solely on his goal.

At the top of the spire, still gripping Tatyana’s arm, Strahd commands Rahadin to protect the door at all costs.

As Strahd and Tatyana step into the open space of the spire, the party becomes mere unseen observers, unable to interact with the world around them. They are present only as witnesses to what unfolds.

The top of the spire, the tallest courtyard of the castle, is battered by a cold, rising wind. The sun hangs low in the sky, slowly sinking behind the desolate landscape.

Tatyana separates from Strahd, moving away from him with stiff, mechanical motions. They remain like this for some time, sitting in silence, with Strahd hovering near her, unable or unwilling to bridge the growing distance.

Strahd attempts to comfort her, insisting that she is safe here, that the castle was built to endure even the fiercest of storms. Tatyana, pale and hollow, responds that no one is safe anymore.

Strahd promises that those responsible for the day’s tragedy will pay dearly, but Tatyana only shakes her head, weary and broken, insisting that vengeance cannot bring Sergei back—or restore what has been lost. She urges Strahd to stop pretending he understands.

In an eruption of emotion, Strahd protests that he understands all too well, confessing that he once loved Marina, and that she too is gone. He pleads, offering Tatyana a future, a life where no one will ever hurt her again.

Tatyana lets out a hollow, humorless laugh, telling him there is no future without Sergei. Strahd speaks only of revenge and power, but for her, none of it matters anymore.

Frustration boils over in Strahd. He cannot bear that Tatyana refuses to see him as anything but a warlord. He recalls how he stood silently while she chose Sergei—a man he deems weak, a man now dead. Strahd, still alive, believes he is the only one left for her.

Tatyana rebuffs him once more, insisting he will never be Sergei. She steps toward the edge of the spire, peering down into the abyss.

Sensing her intent, Strahd, with tears streaming down his face, pleads with her to stay, to not throw herself away.

Tatyana turns to him, her eyes emptied of hope. She asks if he can even hear himself—speaking of burning enemies, of suffering and domination. She condemns him, claiming he embodies none of the compassion or spirit that Sergei once held.

Strahd, now openly weeping, confesses that control is all he has left—the only way he knows to keep what he loves close.

Tatyana exhales, a shallow, final breath, and tells him she refuses to become another possession entombed in his castle.

With that, she steps over the edge and vanishes into the void.

Without hesitation, Milos leaps after her, feeling her falling tears strike him as he dives into the abyss.

He reaches her, grasping her hand in freefall, and tells her that in every lifetime, they will find each other, and in every lifetime, they are in love.

Tatyana places a trembling hand on his face, her gaze filled with a final, tender light. She whispers that she will love him in every lifetime, calling him her beloved Sergei.

Milos answers her with the same vow, as the darkness rises to meet them.

Back on the courtyard, the wind falls silent once more, and time itself seems to stop. The party stands as unseen witnesses to the unfolding events. Strahd remains at the edge of the courtyard, trembling, his arms limp at his sides. He falls to his knees, pleading like a child in pain, begging the Dark Powers to explain why he cannot have her—why he cannot have a life of his own.

A silhouette appears beside him, a woman made entirely of shadow. She whispers for his ears alone, *"So you shall. You made the choices. You gave the blood. You were brave and you were right. He was in the way."*

Strahd argues that he gave up everything, yet Tatyana is still gone. The dark woman responds, *"Not gone. Never gone. You’ll see her again."*

Desperation overtakes Strahd. He begs Vampyr to bring Tatyana back so they might have a life together. Vampyr, with that same seductive voice, assures him she will grant what has been denied. He will have countless chances.

Tearfully, Strahd gives everything he has, surrendering it all to Vampyr. He cries out, telling the Dark Powers to take everything—anything—if only they would give Tatyana back so he might try again.

Vampyr smiles, promising he will have his chances—and all the time in the world.

The natural flow of time resumes. The wind picks up once more. From the mists below, hands made of mist rise to catch Milos and Tatyana, but they pass through them, vanishing into the abyss below.

The Shards of Dawn watch as the mists spill over the land of Barovia like a flood released from a shattered dam.

Strahd asks the Dark Powers if Tatyana will remember. Vampyr's voice coos once more: *"She will come to you. In time, she will love you. Your story has just begun."*

Strahd stands still, overlooking the abyss, when the door behind him slams open. Andral bursts through, flanked by three guards. Fury and heartbreak in his voice, he accuses Strahd of murdering Sergei.

Strahd laughs, a bitter, broken sound. He says he killed Sergei because he was never enough for any of them. Andral retorts that Sergei loved him, admired him, and that he himself loved Strahd as one of his own children. Strahd, cold and detached, insists that nobody loved him. He announces that Tatyana has thrown herself to her death.

Andral, his grief turning to rage, accuses Strahd of not only killing Sergei but also driving Tatyana to despair. Strahd defends himself, claiming he gave everything for a chance to be seen. Andral corrects him, saying that Strahd always wanted to be worshipped. Andral vows to stop him, but Strahd, now almost amused, invites him to try. He assures Andral that he will always remember what Strahd is—but that Andral will be forgotten.

At that moment, Balverzi assassins strike, firing crossbow bolts into Strahd. He falls to his knees just as the last rays of the sun disappear below the horizon.

Leo Dilisnya strides into the courtyard, smug and victorious, his assassins at his side. He smiles cruelly and declares, *"Lord Strahd, at last, we see you on your knees. Look at you now\! Funny, isn’t it? You built this throne and in the end, it will belong to somebody else. You ruled like a god. Now, you will die like a man."*

Leo pulls the trigger on his own crossbow and shoots Strahd through the chest. Strahd falls backward, lifeless. Leo turns to his guards and triumphantly proclaims that Barovia is now free, the tyrant dead and the line of von Zarovich ended.

Night falls as the last light of day disappears. The wind dies completely. Blood that had spilled from Strahd’s wounds begins to shimmer in the darkness and, impossibly, flows backward into his corpse.

The air trembles as the voices of the Dark Powers rise in a cacophonous chorus: *"Rise, King of Night. Your kingdom has been sealed."*

Before their horrified eyes, Strahd rises into the air. His wounds are gone. His skin is pale and youthful once more. His eyes open—burning an unholy crimson.

He lands softly on the ground and, with terrifying speed, slaughters the assassins around him. His fangs flash as he drinks deeply from the blood of his enemies.

Behind him, the mists roll ever higher, pouring into every corner of the land and sealing Barovia away from the outside world.

As the mists engulf the scene, the Shards of Dawn catch one last glimpse of Leo, desperately fleeing for his life.

The vision dissolves, and the party finds themselves back at Duskswallow, gathered around the fire where they first began reading from the Tome. Across from them, sitting elegantly atop a log, is Strahd—watching them in silence, his expression unreadable.

As the Shards of Dawn return from the vision, they find Strahd seated elegantly on a log across from them—composed, expressionless. He greets the party, stating that he imagines they may have questions about what they have just witnessed.

At the sight of Strahd, Ezmeralda rises in a flash, her rapier drawn and pointed directly at him. Strahd regards her with a bored expression and offers a friendly suggestion: she should learn from her past and refrain from acting so rashly. With clear reluctance, she sheathes her weapon and sits back down.

At this point, Milos steps forward, carrying the Tome to Strahd. Strahd accepts it, running his fingers across the leather binding and pausing on the embossed crest of his family. Without ceremony, he tosses the Tome into the fire. As the flames consume it, the arcane magic binding the book begins to unravel.

Tian springs into action, reaching into the fire to retrieve the Tome. But as his hand enters the flames, his entire body goes numb, his spine stiffens, and he is overcome with searing, unprecedented pain. He is forced to release the book back into the fire.

Strahd holds the spell a moment longer before releasing Tian. He offers an apology for restraining him but makes it clear that his decision to destroy the Tome is final and not open to challenge.

He then turns to the party, asking for their thoughts on the vision: did they witness a victim or a villain? Sally responds that she saw both—Strahd as a victim of the Dark Powers, but also as a villain for condemning his entire kingdom along with himself.

Strahd reflects on this response, then asks the party what they make of the fact that Leo Delisnya’s bones are in the possession of Fiona Wachter. When the Shards of Dawn do not answer immediately, he continues, explaining that Lady Wachter believed she was doing him a favor—attempting to do what she thought was right. However, Strahd views her actions as presumptuous, a reminder was necessary to show her who truly holds the leash.

Sally asks how Leo met his end. Strahd, with a smile, replies that he ensured Leo’s death personally. It was, he says, a disgusting and cowardly demise, and he confirms that Leo’s soul is no longer in Barovia.

He then inquires why the party informed him about Fiona’s possession of the bones in the first place. Tian explains that the relationship with Lady Wachter had been strained at the time and there was some ill intent behind the revelation—but now that relationship has improved.

Strahd’s attention then shifts to Ireena, asking whether the vision has changed anything for her. Ireena, still in shock from the events, remains silent. To deflect Strahd’s focus, Sally interjects and asks if he regrets any of it.

Strahd responds that he no longer has the luxury of regret, and even if he did, he doubts there were other paths he could have taken. His gaze then shifts to Arabelle. The attention causes her to shrink back slightly, and Ziva instinctively pulls her closer. After a lingering moment, Strahd casually looks away.

He continues, reflecting on Sally’s question. He speaks of his freedom being stripped away, and how he still wonders whether that loss was the result of a true choice or simply the absence of options. He does not seek to justify his actions, only to express that he believes this is his fate—one even Madame Eva foresaw, despite his efforts to resist it for years.

The subject then shifts. Strahd mentions losing connection to the party’s presence in the Tome for a time and asks what occurred during that period. Sally responds, recounting the meeting in Tatyana’s room, where Tatyana already seemed to know what was to come.

Strahd is deeply intrigued. He asks follow-up questions: did it look and feel like the rest of the vision? What did the party discuss?

Milos responds that the encounter felt very much like the rest of the vision. Tatyana appears nervous, questioning her choices and clearly afraid of what lies ahead—almost as if she already knows what is about to happen.

Strahd then turns to Ireena and asks if she has spoken to Tatyana. She nods. She has seen it all. Ireena expresses no desire to speak of fate or prophecy; she has endured more than enough of both. What she has seen is a man who once had everything and chose to destroy it.

To her surprise, Strahd agrees with her. Still, he reiterates his resolution: he will no longer chase her, but that does not mean he is giving up. This time, he waits. Every time he pursued her, the world took her from him. Now, he will let her choose. When she is ready, she is to come to Ravenloft—as herself. The party notices that Strahd struggles to call her Ireena, as if the name resists him.

Strahd’s attention then shifts to Milos. He asks if Milos saw anything of note in the vision. Milos replies that he now knows a part of Sergey’s soul resides within him. Strahd immediately dismisses any hopes this might raise, stating that what Milos carries is merely a sliver of Sergey’s soul—an echo of the man he once was.

Milos gives a dry laugh and remarks that Sergey’s soul is not the only one within him. Somewhere between the two, he insists, he remains himself as well.

Strahd is intrigued. He hadn’t expected Milos to be aware of the other soul. He muses aloud, wondering what Sergey would have thought if he had seen what Milos has become.

Ziva interjects, arguing that Milos has been dealt a much harsher hand than Sergey ever was. Any comparison between the two is inherently flawed. Strahd seizes on this point, claiming that this is precisely what fascinates him—would Sergey have turned out more like Milos, had he faced the same trials?

Ziva counters that it hardly matters now. Sergey is dead. His opinion, had he lived, is irrelevant.

Strahd then poses a question to the party: do they still consider him the enemy?

Tian responds first, stating that he does not believe Strahd to be the enemy. Sally, clearly incredulous, replies that she does still consider him the villain.

Strahd is visibly amused by their conflicting perspectives, but he answers their follow-up questions nonetheless. Yes, he had died at the hands of Leo Delisnya—twice, in fact—though he admits the term “death” is being used loosely.

Tian asks if anyone else has read the Tome before the current party. Strahd confirms that a few others have tried, but none got far—certainly not as far as the Shards of Dawn.

When asked how the Tome ended up in the dusty attic of the Vallakovich estate, Strahd admits to releasing it into the land himself. He had been experimenting—trying something new.

Tian argues once more that the Tome did not need to be destroyed. It contained vital information and a detailed history of what had come to pass. He expresses a degree of sympathy toward Strahd, revealing that he, too, was raised under the weight of familial expectations. Unlike Strahd, however, Tian chose to flee rather than become a weapon for his family.

Strahd acknowledges the sentiment. Then, looking at the rest of the party, he muses aloud—he wishes they could surprise him and kill him. His gaze settles on Ezmeralda. He notes how much she has grown and remarks that it is a shame *he*—van Richten—isn’t here to see it.

He continues, observing that few pupils survive their masters, and fewer still try to redeem them. He asks Ezmeralda where van Richten is, admitting he is eager to find him. Ezmeralda responds curtly, stating that the last time she saw him, he turned his back on her and left.

Strahd presses on, remarking that van Richten taught her how to burn bridges but never told her what she truly is, nor what her blood can do. He wonders aloud whether van Richten kept her close out of care, guilt, or fear.

Ezmeralda spits back her contempt, declaring she would rather choke on ash than utter van Richten’s name again. She survived—only for him to leave her behind.

Strahd agrees with Ezmeralda, stating that she has become exactly what van Richten needed her to be: silent, sharp, and disposable. He wonders aloud if, by pulling her from that burning cart, he merely left her to bleed in the snow all these years later.

At these words, Ezmeralda springs to her feet, drawing her rapier with lethal intent. She lunges toward Strahd, but Ziva intercepts her, grasping her wrist and halting her advance. Ziva reminds her that Strahd is only baiting her—that she cannot kill him, not yet—and that after only just finding her again, she refuses to lose her.

Ezmeralda pauses, fury flashing in her eyes, before stomping away in frustration.

Milos then steps forward, retrieving the lead box containing the bones of Leo Dilisnya. He hands it over to Strahd. In return, Strahd thanks the party for upholding their end of the bargain. He explains that he wanted the bones because they all understand the kind of power such remnants can hold.

Sally asks whether their agreement still stands if one of Strahd’s consorts attacks and the party defends itself. Strahd replies that the deal holds as long as it remains mutually beneficial. His consorts act primarily under his orders, but they retain free will. Should one attack the party and, by some miracle, be defeated, he would not consider that grounds for ending their partnership.

His gaze then shifts to Arabelle—cold, curious. He has seen many raunis in his long life, but she is different. She does not merely look; she remembers, even if she does not yet realize it. She watches carefully. She is afraid, but not surprised.

Arabelle responds that some things in Barovia repeat themselves endlessly. Sometimes, the land remembers, even when the people forget.

Intrigued, Strahd asks if the land, in remembering, ever tries to change.

Arabelle replies that perhaps not the land—but maybe someone else might.

When Strahd asks if she understands the weave of fate and the flow of time, Arabelle, as if caught in a trance, answers that spirals are just circles pretending to move forward—and sometimes the world forgets which came first.

Strahd considers this and muses that perhaps the world chooses what it wants to remember, in order to survive. He speaks more to himself now, confessing that there may be something he has overlooked—a hand reaching back from the wrong direction. Someone has been weaving while he hasn’t been watching.

At this, Arabelle’s expression briefly changes in recognition. She tries to conceal it, but Strahd notices. He tells her that this is not her weave, then abruptly turns to Ziva, who has been watching the exchange with unease.

He asks her how long she has worn other faces, claiming that her purpose is new, though her face is not. Ziva stares at him, utterly confused. Strahd turns his gaze away, declaring that Eva has grown reckless and must be reminded that her weave is not immune to thinning.

With that, he bows to the party and departs.

Arabelle grows frantic. She fears that Eva may be in danger and immediately begins rifling through her Tarokka deck.

Meanwhile, Milos seeks out Ezmeralda and informs her that Strahd is gone. As they walk back toward the group, he quietly admits that he, too, was trained by van Richten—just a year ago.

Back at the campfire, after Ezmeralda and Milos return, Sally asks Ziva about her relationship with Ezmeralda. Ziva explains that Ezmeralda was her best friend—at least, that’s how she remembers it from when they were children.

At this, Ezmeralda rises and embraces Ziva tightly, overwhelmed with emotion and disbelief at her survival. Ziva admits she doesn’t know how she’s alive. She recalls little after the attack on the Vistani camp—fragmented memories that only started resurfacing since arriving in Barovia. She shares that she was raised outside the mists, by loving parents who spoiled her, living a happy and peaceful life until Barovia pulled her back in.

Sally interjects, noting that Ziva’s account doesn’t align with Ezmeralda’s age—Ez having admitted to being seventy—while Ziva insists she is only twenty-four. Ezmeralda reminds the group that Vistani age differently than humans, but Ziva holds firm. She remembers every birthday and has no reason to doubt her age.

Ezmeralda concedes that time might have affected her differently, especially given that she spent years training outside Barovia. She adds that Madame Eva is over five hundred years old. Turning to the rest of the party, Ezmeralda informs them she has come from Krezk and intends to return, as troubling circumstances continue there.

Ziva then looks to Milos and asks whether he truly believes he is Sergey. Milos nods, distractedly confirming it. Ziva tries to reassure him, reminding him that he is his own person—Sergey’s fate does not dictate his path, and he is free to make his own choices.

But Milos pushes back. He argues that his identity only proves how broken he is, doomed to follow a path laid by fate whether he wishes to or not. Ziva insists he still has agency—that his choices are his own. Milos abruptly cuts her off, asking if worshipping Shar was ever her choice. When she replies that it wasn’t, that the choice was made for her, Milos ends the discussion with a quiet declaration: his case is closed. He turns away from her and focuses his attention on Tian.

Meanwhile, Sally has been pressing Tian to clarify his earlier statement—that he doesn’t see Strahd as the enemy. Tian reiterates his position. He does not believe Strahd can be truly killed, which is why he has shifted his focus to the Dark Powers themselves. He no longer places his faith in gods or their shadows, but in people. His allegiance lies with the Shards of Dawn, and he is committed to doing whatever it takes to free Barovia.

Sally approaches Ireena, who appears shaken and lost in thought. She asks how Ireena is holding up. Ireena remains silent for a moment, then says only that she wishes to speak with Milos.

Suddenly, Arabelle whimpers, then lets out a quiet, strangled sob. She reveals that Strahd is heading to kill Eva—and Eva knows it. But Eva has chosen not to run. She will stay and meet her fate, rather than fight to save herself. Arabelle feels like a pawn in Eva’s greater design—helpless, expendable.

Ziva offers a theory: perhaps Eva is a central thread in the weave of fate, and only through her death can the pattern shift beyond her influence. Perhaps Eva is deliberately pushing the threads toward something unaligned with the will of others. Ziva recoils at the idea of fate controlling her life. She refuses to accept that her path is predetermined. Whatever the consequences, she wants her choices to be her own, and she will gladly face those consequences—so long as she knows they were hers to make.

Exhausted after a long day, the Shards of Dawn retreat to rest. As Milos passes Ireena, he offers a quiet apology before returning to the fire. There, he keeps watch over Arabelle, who is still poring over her cards.

As morning breaks, the party begins to stir. Tian quietly moves about the kitchen, preparing breakfast for everyone. Ziva steps outside and finds Arabelle, who has remained under the stars with Ezmeralda and has barely slept. Arabelle confides that she spent the night tossing and turning, plagued by worry over Madame Eva’s fate. Ziva sits beside her, gently brushing her hair as Arabelle shares more about her restless night.

At the edge of the forest, Milos moves through the underbrush when a sudden instinct forces him to duck. A crossbow bolt whistles past his head. He looks up to see Ezmeralda among the trees, her crossbow still aimed at him. She challenges him to a sparring match, and without hesitation, they engage.

Ez is swift and agile, her movements fluid despite her wooden leg. She strikes first, but Milos parries with his sword and counters with a powerful blow from his flail. She recovers quickly, her eyes going black as she mutters a Vistani incantation. A spell takes hold of Milos, paralyzing him. Ez advances, taking advantage of his immobility. With effort, Milos breaks free and retaliates just as Ez releases a crackling bolt of lightning. He narrowly avoids it.

As she closes in again, Milos strikes her and, in a calculated move, feigns a bite to unsettle her. The moment his fangs near her throat, searing pain flares in his lips—she has protective wards in place. Ez’s eyes flare with arcane energy, and another incantation conjures a glowing Magic Circle beneath Milos. A cylindrical force field shoots up around him, trapping him within.

Unable to escape the circle, Milos waits as Ez calms. Once composed, she dispels the field. Impressed, she admits admiration for his skill and questions who trained him. Milos explains he has had no formal training—his movements are purely instinctual. Ez is taken aback. Most vampires in Barovia fight with savage disorganization, she says—except for two: Strahd and Baron Methus. Milos’s style matches theirs, marked by discipline and battlefield awareness. To her, he fights like an ancient vampire, not one turned just a year ago.

She heals his wounds and thanks him for the sparring match. As their duel ends, Tian arrives with breakfast, and the party gathers to eat.

Ziva quietly excuses herself and slips into the forest, just beyond the tree line. There, she removes one of her bracers and rolls up her sleeve, revealing a patchwork of scars—defensive wounds left by Villeneuve’s attack. Drawing her dagger, she traces it over one of the healed cuts, reopening the flesh. She then casts Cure Wounds, watching intently as the magic mends the fresh injury. To her relief, the scar vanishes completely. Her spirits lifted by the success, she returns to rejoin the others.

Later that morning, Milos approaches Ziva and asks her to send a message to Lady Wachter, relaying key developments:

* The werewolves have a new leader.  
* Duskswallow is leaderless and on the verge of collapse.  
* Strahd has departed, taking the sacred bones with him.

Ziva casts Sending, delivering the news. Wachter responds with her own updates: the toymaker, Blinski, is secure and continuing his work, but troubling rumors about Milos have reached her ears.

Curious, Ziva questions Milos about what he did during their last visit to Vallaki. He dodges the question, but Ireena interjects—revealing that Milos may have founded a cult. The atmosphere shifts. Milos, in no mood for jest or debate, vows to kill every last cultist in Vallaki. Ez, observing his response, quietly concludes that he might be a sociopath.  
Throughout the morning, Arabelle remains withdrawn, quietly poring over her cards, her focus detached from the rest of the group. Ziva notices and approaches, sensing the weight pressing on the girl’s mind.

Arabelle confides that she is troubled by thoughts of Eva—haunted by the fear that she may have overlooked something, that she could have prevented Eva’s fate. Ziva attempts to comfort her, reminding her that the past is immutable, and dwelling on what-ifs only harms herself.

Yet Arabelle’s unease lingers. She has never experienced a false vision, nor had Eva. Still, during their time together, Eva often skirted around a certain topic. She had warned that in Barovia, for its people, free will is an illusion. Everything that happens has already happened, and nothing can unfold differently. Even Arabelle’s choices, Eva once said, are choices she has already made.

Ziva urges her to take a step back, suggesting that she has spent too long staring into the cards. Eva was always cryptic, and trying to unravel her words too precisely is a fool’s errand. Perhaps the answer will reveal itself when Arabelle least expects it.

The Shards of Dawn set off once more, their journey continuing through the mist-laden wilderness of Barovia. Following his spar with Ez, Milos admits to feeling a deep hunger and begins searching for an animal to feed upon. Sally intervenes quickly, preventing him—unwilling to allow the local wildlife to become his prey.

Meanwhile, Ireena attempts to strike up a conversation with Ez. Though well-intentioned, she soon discovers that Ez’s manner is blunt and unfiltered. Ez speaks her mind without hesitation—not out of cruelty, but because she doesn’t pause to consider how her words may land. The attempt at connection falters under the weight of Ez’s stark honesty.

Ireena approaches Milos with a heavy heart, seeking clarity after the overwhelming truths revealed during the vision within the Tome. She asks whether he managed to catch Tatyana when he leapt after her. Milos confirms that he did—and that Tatyana recognized him as Sergei.

She then presses further, asking what his feelings for her truly mean, especially since he had confessed his love before learning he was Sergei. Milos answers simply: he loves her. He always has, since childhood, long before his transformation into a vampire. Ireena admits that she can’t deny the emotions that surface when she looks at him—but she’s not in a place where she can unravel them.

Milos reflects aloud, uncertain whether his feelings stem from the fragment of Sergei's soul within him or from his love for Ireena herself. She echoes the same doubt, wondering whether what they feel is genuine or merely the result of fate or the Dark Powers manipulating them.

Ireena proposes they make a pact: to see each other as individuals, not as echoes of Tatyana and Sergei. Milos agrees, adding that he loved her before he knew who they once were. Ireena admits the same—but explains that it’s hard to feel anything clearly now. She’s unsure whether Milos has buried parts of himself beneath his anger, or if those parts are simply gone.

Milos confesses he has endured more than he can name. He doesn’t know if he will ever be the man he once was, but he is trying to discover who he wants to become. Ireena assures him she holds no judgment for the path he took; she would never condemn someone for making a different choice.

Their conversation shifts to Strahd—how he tampered with Milos’s memories. Ireena asks if he truly believes Strahd is responsible, or if it was a lie. Milos isn’t sure. He knows that vampirism heightens one’s flaws and emotions to extreme levels. Whether Strahd did more than that remains uncertain.

What Milos does know is the ache that has plagued him for a long time—a feeling of inadequacy, of being unworthy of her love. It was that doubt which kept him silent for so long. Now, he has no energy left for regrets. He no longer cares. He is tired—exhausted—and has accepted that his role will end in death.

Ireena urges him not to give up. She remembers the man who once cared deeply, whose conviction inspired others to follow him in rebellion. That part of him gave people hope. Milos, however, meets her words with bitterness—those who followed him are dead, save for Escher.

Still, Ireena clings to belief. She wants to be her own person, free from prophecy and reincarnation. Milos, in turn, declares that he will not hide in the shadows. He is owed a sunrise. He vows to bring the sun to Barovia, then watch its light as it consumes him.

At this, Ireena offers a small smile. Perhaps, in time, she can show him what a sunrise can truly be.

They fall into a quiet, companionable silence.

High overhead, Tian soars through the clouds, scouting the landscape. Strange sounds and laughter drift up from below, catching his attention. In the distance, a shimmering body of water reflects the dim Barovian light.

As he scans the terrain, a raven catches his eye—its flight unsteady, its feathers dull. The bird climbs higher and higher, then abruptly drops, lifeless, to the ground.

Tian swoops down, cradling the raven’s limp form in his arms. He brings it to Sally, who examines it closely. Though the bird appears freshly fallen, she determines it has been dead for some time. Worse, there is evidence of a plague coursing through its body—something unnatural.

The party turns to Ziva for her insight. She studies the raven and speculates that it was likely animated with necromantic magic. This, she insists, is not something the Keepers of the Feather would do to one of their own.

Tian asks whether the bird can be brought back. Ziva answers that she can reanimate it using the same necrotic energy—but if she does, it will return not as itself, but as a puppet under her will. It will offer no answers.

Ziva turns and climbs into Ezmeralda’s coach, settling beside her. With a teasing glint in her eye, she challenges Ez to a dance-off, wondering aloud whether the injury has dulled her edge. Ez accepts without hesitation, and the two begin to reminisce as the road stretches before them.

Ziva speaks of her time in Waterdeep, where she lived and worked as a courtesan. Ez shares her own memories, recalling her harsh training in the wilds. Their conversation drifts to childhood mischief, the chaos they used to cause, and the bond they once shared. Ziva recalls the night their camp was attacked by Van Richten—how she searched desperately for Ez, saw the night creatures converging on her family’s carts, but found no trace of her friend.

Then, Ziva reveals something new: a memory of that same night, when she looked upon Van Richten and saw that he had been cursed by a Vistana. The revelation shocks Ez. She curses Van Richten’s name, furious that he never spoke of this to her. She vows to investigate further.

Their talk shifts to more urgent matters. Ez brings the party up to speed on the situation in Krezk. The town is in shambles, sealed off entirely under the command of Dimitri Krezkov and his family. Of the Krezkov line, only one child remains alive—and he is gravely ill.

Ziva introduces Sally as a gifted healer, particularly skilled with children. Ez, however, explains that Krezk already has a healer—one who may be part of the town’s downfall. Residing in the abbey, this man offers his “cures” through grotesque means: performing surgeries on the sick, cutting away diseased flesh and grafting animal parts onto human bodies.

Milos recalls encountering one such creature in Castle Ravenloft, a chimera-like being. He remembers it as peaceful. Ez agrees—the ones she met were docile—but she has heard darker rumors. Whispers claim the abbot is attempting to reanimate a corpse.

Ez then shifts to the topic of the werewolf pack. Under the old leader, Tornescu, the wolves could be reasoned with. But since Kiril took control, the situation has worsened. Where once they only attacked those who wandered too far into their domain, they now abduct children. Ez suspects Kiril is infecting them with lycanthropy—training them as wolf cubs.

Ziva wonders aloud whether he is building an army. Ez admits she is uncertain if Kiril is working directly with Strahd, but the two share a disturbingly similar outlook.

The Shards of Dawn reach their destination—Rictavio’s tower, a weathered structure rising from the waters of Lake Baratok, connected to the mainland by a narrow, precarious path.

As the party approaches, Sally asks with genuine curiosity whether towers like this exist in Waterdeep. Ziva scoffs, remarking that perhaps such structures can be found in the slums.

Despite the tower’s age and deterioration, a palpable aura of magic emanates from it. Milos and Ziva advance to the front door. Ziva attempts to contact Rictavio using a Message spell, but the magic fails—there is no response, as if Rictavio is unreachable… or dead.

Just as Milos raises his hand to knock, Ezmeralda shouts for him to stop. But it's too late.

Milos unknowingly triggers a magical trap the moment his hand raps against the tower’s front door. In response, a massive skeletal dragon materializes, erupting into violent motion as it immediately attacks the party.

Ezmeralda reacts first, shouting that every trap must have a disabling mechanism—and that they cannot hope to defeat the dragon through brute force alone. The party quickly realizes that magic in the vicinity of the tower does not function properly. A powerful anti-magic field surrounds the structure, and any spellcasting requires attunement to the unique frequency of the field’s arcane interference.

As the other members of the Shards of Dawn work together to lure the dragon away, Ziva turns her attention to the door itself, suspecting it holds the key to disarming the trap. Her eyes catch a carved pattern—a large central circle surrounded by six smaller ones. She quickly deduces that the central circle represents the tower. Nearby, she spots several circular pedestals that emit a low, magical hum.

Closing her eyes, Ziva focuses on the unnatural thrum of the anti-magic field around them. It becomes clear that the field was created by a highly skilled magic-user—someone who understood the weave deeply enough to leave a “gap” in its suppression. This gap harmonizes with a specific magical frequency, meaning only casters attuned to that resonance can bypass the field and use magic within it.

She further concludes that the dragon’s presence is directly tied to the trap that summoned it—solving the puzzle should dispel the creature entirely.

Ezmeralda begins distracting the dragon, demonstrating surprising knowledge of dragon behavior, including mimicry of mating sounds to draw its attention. Meanwhile, the rest of the party coordinates around the pedestals, attempting to activate them in the correct sequence.

Several failed attempts result in magical surges that explode from the incorrectly activated pedestals, injuring those standing atop them. Eventually, through trial and error, all six pedestals are triggered in the proper order. The arcane humming intensifies and culminates in a sudden silence—the skeletal dragon dissipates, vanishing into the ether.

After regrouping and tending to their wounds, Ziva studies the tower again. There’s something familiar about it—its construction echoes the grandeur and menace of Castle Ravenloft. Examining the entrance more closely, she discovers an etched signature: *Khazan Artimus Fidatov*, the renowned architect responsible for building Ravenloft itself.

Ezmeralda paces nearby, restless and agitated, admitting that both the tower and its magic unsettle her deeply. With no further resistance at the door, the party opens it and steps inside.

The door swings open, revealing a dim, dust-covered entry level. The space appears abandoned save for a central platform and four imposing clay golems. As the party enters, the golems animate and demand payment in exchange for access to the elevator—the only means of reaching the upper floors. Failure to comply, they warn, will result in violence.

Milos steps forward and barters for passage using a pair of undergarments from the “New Milosovich” collection. The golems accept the offering.

The party crowds into the elevator, barely fitting. The ascent is anything but graceful—Tian lets out a disruptive fart, prompting Milos to vomit. Sally casts *Shape Water* to redirect the worst of the mess, managing to contain most of it—though the larger chunks remain.

When the elevator finally grinds to a stop on the fourth floor, the scene shifts dramatically. The room is warm and lived-in, filled with arcane devices, thick rugs, and a cluttered desk. Strange magical contraptions line the space, hinting at the eccentricity of the tower’s long-absent owner.

A familiar elf stands at the center of the room, smiling warmly, arms open in greeting. Rictavio beams at the party—until his gaze lands on Ezmeralda. His expression falters, if only for a moment, before he quickly recovers. He makes no move to shake her hand, and she eyes him with open suspicion and thinly veiled hostility. Unimpressed, she brushes past him and begins inspecting the books in his library.

Rictavio offers tea to the group, clearly pleased by their arrival. Ziva takes the opportunity to introduce Arabelle as her sister. Once again, Rictavio declines a handshake. When Ziva questions his reluctance to make physical contact with the Vistani, he chuckles, claiming he has his secrets—and prefers not to risk either Ez or Arabelle gleaning anything through touch.

This only deepens Milos’s distrust. He quietly moves to the back of the room to stand beside Ezmeralda, watching Rictavio closely.

Unbothered by their scrutiny, Rictavio engages the rest of the Shards of Dawn in conversation, asking about their recent dealings with Strahd. When the party explains that a tentative truce currently exists between them and the vampire lord, Rictavio’s expression sharpens. He questions whether their allegiance has shifted.

The party clarifies: no, they have not changed sides. For the moment, their interests align with Strahd’s. It is not peace—merely a fragile convenience.

Turning back to Ez, Rictavio remarks that he has heard much about her. Ezmeralda scoffs, narrowing her eyes even further. Her distrust remains palpable. She warns the others not to give him too much information.

Rictavio takes her hostility in stride and continues speaking to the group, offering a few pieces of intelligence:

Dimitri Krezkov is reportedly furious over the lack of wine.  
The Martikov family has grown unusually quiet. Whether the vineyards are rebelling or the family is being cautious remains unclear.  
The Wizard of Wines winery once flourished due to three powerful gemstones—artifacts that infused the land with magic. One was lost long ago. A second disappeared a few months back. The third was stolen just a month ago—around the same time the wine ceased to flow.  
Without these magical gems, the vineyard is ordinary and incapable of producing grapes, much like the rest of the land.

Rictavio explains that retrieving these artifacts could restore the vineyard’s power and help mend relations with the Martikovs.

Ezmeralda cuts in again, bluntly demanding to know who Rictavio truly is. He responds with dramatic flair, calling himself a scholar, a fashion icon, a monster expert, and the most charming elf this side of the mists. A tense silence follows, marked by a cold-eyed stare between him and Ez.

Milos then shares that the party intends to infiltrate Castle Ravenloft within the week to retrieve someone, though he refrains from sharing further details. Rictavio, pleased by the disclosure, offers something in return.

He reveals that Strahd leaves the castle every two weeks and visits three known locations:

* A site southwest of Barovia, near the ruins of Berez  
* The blighted lands surrounding Yester Hill  
* A place near the castle itself, close to an old mill

With this information, Ziva and Sally begin to piece together a pattern. They suspect Strahd is visiting the ancient shrines of the Rozanas, attempting to consolidate control over the siphons that draw power from the land itself.

Milos admits to once serving as Strahd’s lieutenant but notes that he does not recall ever encountering Rictavio during his time in the castle.

As Rictavio remarks that Ezmeralda would be of great use in their coming efforts, she once again demands to know his true identity. Before he can answer, a massive explosion suddenly rocks the tower, shaking its very foundations.

The anti-magic shield surrounding Rictavio’s tower begins to flicker—then vanishes entirely. Magic surges back into place, accessible once more to all within its radius.

Rictavio immediately rises, his expression darkening into something cold and focused. From outside, a familiar voice carries up through the cracked stone walls—Volenta’s mocking tone rings out, taunting and playful: *“Don’t make us wait.”*

The party rushes to the window. Below, three striking women stand at the base of the tower, encircled by snarling wolves. Strahd’s brides have arrived.

Anastrasya raises her voice, calm and honeyed, suggesting Rictavio surrender peacefully. Her tone is pleasant, but the threat is unmistakable.

Another explosion rocks the tower, and this time, it’s not just a tremor—the very structure groans under the impact. Stones shift, and the tower’s integrity begins to buckle.

Ziva turns to Rictavio, asking if he has any way of escaping—if he can teleport to safety. He confirms that he can, but he requires more time. Without hesitation, Ziva tells him to go. The Shards of Dawn will delay the brides.

Milos steps outside, walking along the tower wall to confront the women, attempting to stall for time. Behind him, Rictavio conjures a portal, preparing for the party to escape the collapsing tower.

Volenta sneers at Milos, mocking how far he’s come. Anastrasya eyes the party’s attempt to shield Rictavio and muses aloud that they are protecting a man they scarcely understand.

Milos, unfazed, calmly asks the women before him if Rictavio is, in fact, Van Richten.

A sudden burst of light flashes, and Rictavio emerges from the tower’s ruins. His cane strikes the ground and shatters—along with the illusion of his elven guise.

In his place stands a tall, gaunt man with white hair and a beard, cloaked in black and clad in monster-hunting gear. There is no warmth in his eyes as he faces the brides. His voice is cold steel: *“Touch them again and I’ll have your heads.”*

At that moment, Ziva and Arabelle stagger as their vision fades to black.

Ziva finds herself seeing through another’s eyes—confident steps carrying her through the Vistani camp at Tser Pool. The Vistani kneel as she—no, as Strahd—passes.

Strahd inquires about Madame Eva’s whereabouts. Rina, the wife of Araja, answers that Eva has gone into the woods and is waiting for him there.

Strahd, amused that Eva has left her hut, turns toward the forest and begins to walk.

Ziva and Arabelle collapse to the ground, both overcome by the visions unfolding at Tser Pool. Their bodies remain limp and trembling as their minds are locked elsewhere.

Volenta erupts into maniacal laughter. Before Anastrasya can intervene, she draws her daggers and charges at van Richten with inhuman speed. Despite his age, van Richten reacts with practiced precision. He draws a gleaming pistol, its chambers loaded with radiant ammunition. Using her momentum against her, he catches Volenta mid-air and hurls her to the side, the impact shattering her wrist.

Before she can recover, he fires. The pistol explodes with searing radiant light as the bullet strikes her chest, driving her back further.

At the same moment, Ezmeralda draws her own firearm and fires a shot at Volenta. Another burst of radiant energy detonates on impact. Her eyes blaze with fury as she shouts at van Richten, accusing him of abandoning her. Van Richten counters coolly, stating that he left to save her life.

Ludmilla watches Ziva with thinly veiled contempt. Seeing her collapsed on the ground, clutching her head, she sneers and asks if Ziva plans to cower through the fight. But Ziva, still caught in the grip of her vision, hears nothing.

Anastrasya once again attempts to de-escalate, stating that the confrontation need not escalate further. They only want van Richten. She turns to Volenta and Ludmilla and reminds them of their orders—urging restraint.

Van Richten, undeterred, retrieves a small vial and hurls it toward the trio. It detonates on impact—a grenade of holy oil and powdered silver. Flames erupt instantly, engulfing the area.

Ezmeralda draws her rapier and leaps into the fire, yelling that van Richten doesn’t have the luxury of dying now. They still have unfinished business.

Tian joins the fray with measured calm, entering the battle with disciplined control.

With poised elegance, Anastrasya raises her hands and conjures a Wall of Fire, encircling the island and sealing the battlefield.

Sally responds swiftly, casting *Moonbeam* down upon Volenta and Anastrasya, radiant energy scorching both. In a blur of movement, she shifts into a dire lynx, her form rippling with power.

Anastrasya makes another call for a truce—but Volenta, caught in a frenzy, ignores her. She howls that Strahd isn’t watching and they may as well enjoy themselves. With a savage grin, she charges at Sally.

Meanwhile, Arabelle lies curled on the ground, eyes wide with tears, whispering the same phrase over and over: *“The same… the same…”*

Ziva, still grounded, reaches out through a *Message* spell and begs van Richten to retreat. His reply is steady and final—this is not his time to run. It is theirs.

Ziva and Arabelle’s vision go black again and they are transported back to the clearing where Eva is having a conversation with Strahd

Eva is sitting in an old ring of stones, perched on a tree stump and tells Strahd he took his time

Strahd steps out without preamble, his eyes intent, never leaving Eva, and wonders just how long she has been watching him. She’s always known more than she said; this was always her charm.

Eva reminded Strahd that he had come to ask questions, not to answer them. But Strahd, circling her slowly, claimed he was indulging in nostalgia. He spoke of a disruption in the mists—a distortion in fate—and admitted he had initially thought it was caused by the girl or the young *seerling*. But then, he said, he remembered who Eva truly was.

Eva warned him to tread carefully, suggesting he was beginning to sound unsure. Strahd denied feeling uncertainty; what he felt, he said, was whatever lay beneath it. He stared into her eyes and accused her of hiding in Barovia for centuries under the guise of a crone, a mystic, a neutral observer. Yet, he pointed out, she had never been truly neutral—she had nudged others, set them on paths, whispered hope into desperate ears—all without openly interfering. He demanded to know why.

Eva responded that she understood the cost of breaking rules in a land that enforced them mercilessly.

Strahd scoffed, accusing her of choosing to remain small, to wear her shawl and pretend she was nothing more than a reader of cards. But he knew she was more than that. He said she had been there when the fanes fell—there with the Seeker. He remembered the Seeker's death at his hands, how her altar had shattered like bone, how the wind had gone still for a week afterward. And somehow, Eva had survived. To him, she was what remained of the Seeker.

She looked away from him then, saying only that what remained was enough.

But Strahd wasn’t finished. He called her a fragment, a whisper, a shadow of a dying god clinging to old rituals and using young pawns. Eva rejected that idea, insisting she did not cling.

Strahd challenged her again, asking if this was her final move, a last desperate gambit. He demanded to know whether she longed for the Seeker’s power—the power she had stolen.

But Eva denied it. The Seeker was gone, she said. She was not her, and she did not desire her power. What she had accepted was her responsibility. All she wanted now was to end the story that required gods.

Meanwhile, in front of Van Richten’s Tower the battle rages on. Ludmilla moves with the same supernatural speed as Volenta, appearing beside Ziva, who remains prone and clutching her head. Without hesitation, Ludmilla sinks her claws into Ziva’s back, raking through flesh and soul with a wave of necrotic energy. She then lifts a hand and casts *Hold Person* on van Richten, attempting to freeze him in place.

Ezmeralda continues shouting at van Richten, demanding he admit that he ran—not to save her, but because he was afraid. Van Richten breaks the paralysis, forcing himself free of the enchantment, and concedes—of course he was afraid.

Milos moves swiftly behind Ludmilla, who looms over the fallen Ziva, and smites her with a surge of radiant energy. He delivers a sharp threat as the divine light sears into her, drawing her attention away from Ziva.

Volenta darts across the battlefield with reckless abandon, tearing into both Tian and Sally, though her fury remains mostly fixed on Sally. Tian rushes to Sally’s defense, landing a series of precise, brutal strikes that leave Volenta stunned and reeling.

Anastrasya flickers in the air like a phantom, her voice calm and persuasive. She charms Tian effortlessly, then turns to Milos with a soft plea—there is still time to walk away. There’s no need for this.

Arabelle, now conscious again, pushes herself to her feet and quietly urges everyone to stay together. Ziva echoes the words aloud, her voice steady despite the pain, and turns her gaze toward Ludmilla. She raises her hands and invokes her *Channel Divinity*, unleashing a wave of radiant power to drive away the undead.

The effect is immediate. Terror floods Ludmilla and Volenta’s faces. Ludmilla breaks into a panicked flight, retreating from Ziva. Volenta, still stunned, is frozen in place. Only Anastrasya resists the divine force, her composure unbroken.

Van Richten reacts with surgical precision, throwing a dagger at Tian. The blade strikes true—not to harm, but to break the enchantment binding his will. As the charm shatters, van Richten calls out, instructing Tian to use the coin Jenny had given them.

Tian retrieves the small token and shouts the activation phrase: *“Pretty penny, show me Jenny\!”* He hurls the coin to the ground. It vibrates with arcane energy, transforming into a twig. Vines burst forth from it, curling and twisting, and the ground beneath it begins to tremble.

Volenta, despite her injuries and the relentless strikes from Tian, remains focused on Sally. Blood pours from her wounds, but she continues laughing maniacally, wild and unhinged.

Anastrasya, watching Ludmilla flee in terror, decides the fight has run its course. She raises her hands and unleashes *Cloudkill*, targeting the cluster around Arabelle and Ziva. A thick, choking fog surges outward.

Moments later, Volenta follows the spell with a crackling *Lightning Bolt*, tearing through the poisoned mist, aiming to obliterate anything caught within it.

Ziva and Arabelle’s vision go black again and they are transported back to the clearing where Eva is having her conversation with Strahd.

Strahd speaks of gods and endings, but reminds Eva that she was never merely a fortune teller. She replies evenly that she never claimed to be. He continues, noting that the land itself feels restless and that the threads of fate are beginning to twist at the edges. He says he has ruled the valley long enough to know its every breath, yet now there’s a pulse out of rhythm. He pauses, curiosity flickering across his face as he looks at her with sudden clarity—he suspects she is the reason.

But Eva tells him it isn’t just her.

Strahd admits that he once believed the curse to be his alone, a punishment meant only for him. Now, however, he realizes that Eva sees something larger—a broader pattern. She confirms it, saying that when the Dark Powers sealed his fate, it wasn’t just death they took. It was divergence. The curse, she explains, never bound Strahd’s will—but it did strip others of the chance to meet him with theirs. The land was locked, shaped into a stage not for growth or change, but to support the greatest lie he tells himself.

At this, his jaw clenches.

Eva presses on, asking how many have tried to stop him, to forgive him, to change him—and how many of them ever truly had the power to do so. Her answer is bleak: none. They were echoes, dust, already condemned to graves chosen by another. That, she says, is the truth he doesn’t want to hear. The cycle he rules was never his creation. It was forged and sealed by the Dark Powers—not as a kingdom, but as a script. One timeline. One path. No branches. No risk. She declares that he will never have her (Ireena), never forget what he did, and never be forgiven. The script forbids it. And in building this stage, everyone suffers—pawns stripped of will and voice, so that the Dark Powers can torment him endlessly.

Strahd calls her a liar. He insists he is destined to receive what he’s due, that he can break the script at will, that he is in control. But she only looks at him with anger thinly veiled by pity—the kind reserved for a child who cannot yet grasp what they’ve lost.

Strahd protests again, saying he remembers the time before—the years before his mother, before the pact. He remembers the future as it once felt: open, infinite, full of possibility. Eva asks him what he sees now.

He answers that now the future is a corridor with no doors. Not just for him—for everyone.

That, Eva tells him, is why she lit the match.

Shocked, Strahd demands to know if she means to burn everything down. But she denies it. She wants only a single moment that is unwritten—a moment outside the loop, unpredictable by the Dark Powers. A choice untouched by the spiral.

Something old stirs behind his eyes as he asks what happens when that moment arrives.

Eva answers simply: the loop breaks, and the script tears itself apart.

Strahd whispers the inevitable next question—what becomes of him when the spiral shatters?

Eva tells him he remains, as he always has. But for the first time, so will the others. The girl who runs. The knight who stands. The child who sees. The healer. The leader. They will cease to be echoes acting out roles for his story. They will make a choice. And they will choose his fate.

And he, at last, will have to live with it.

Back in front of van Richten’s tower, the twig spawned by the coin begins to grow—rapidly and unnaturally—stretching upward until it towers above even Van Richten’s crumbling stronghold. Its bark thickens and spirals, forming a massive tree far taller than the tower itself.

At its base, a singular door creaks open, carved seamlessly into the trunk. Van Richten shouts for everyone to get to the tree. As the door swings wide, Jenny steps out with her familiar wobble, surveying the chaos with sharp, discerning eyes. She calls for the group to hurry inside and pointedly mentions to van Richten that she has fulfilled her end of the deal—she gave them the coin, just as he asked.

The party begins to sprint toward the door, all except Sally, who still lies stunned by Volenta’s brutal onslaught. Without hesitation, Milos races to her side, lifts her into his arms, and throws her through the doorway.

Ziva, bloodied and wavering on the edge of consciousness, grabs Arabelle’s hand and propels her through the opening before stumbling in after her. The moment they both cross the threshold, Ziva’s vision distorts again. She and Arabelle collapse onto the floor, screaming in unison as they are transported back to the clearing near Tser’s Pool.

Van Richten is the last to act. He shoves Ezmeralda through the doorway despite her protests. She pleads for him to follow—they have too much left unsaid—but he does not budge. With a somber expression, he tells her that whatever lives inside him is a danger to those he cares for. The only way to protect her now is to stay behind.

Before she can stop him, he closes the door, locking himself outside.

Back in the clearing, Ziva and Arabelle watch on, helpless, not being able to interfere, since only their consciousness is there.

Strahd accuses Eva of watching from the shadows for so long, only now choosing to interfere. But Eva calmly corrects him—she hasn’t interfered, she has invested.

He demands to know why, and why now. She answers that after all this time, the thread was finally ready to snap. He knows how it works: a single timeline, pulled taut by the Dark Powers so that nothing can deviate—no branches, no futures, no choice. She tells him she couldn’t tear it, not in its current form, not even as what she once was.

So, she says, she did the one thing the god he killed had once begged her to do—she broke herself.

Strahd seems stunned as she explains further. She shattered into three pieces—three lives. One mind. One heart. One will. Each part born inside the thread, woven into the story, made real.

She begins to name them:

* One is the seer, meant to remember, to learn, to travel and plan. But that one cannot act directly. (Eva)  
* Another is meant to feel, to laugh, to cry, and to teach the last why it all matters—to love her. (Arabelle)  
* And the last… the final piece is the one the Dark Powers never accounted for. A paradox. A contradiction. A being who holds free will within herself, and by having it, can pass it to others. The one who can choose, and allow others to choose in turn. The one who can break the cycle. (Ziva)

Strahd takes a step back in awe as the implications sink in. He realizes Eva has placed herself in three different points along the timeline. He demands to know who the last one is—where and when she exists within the tapestry.

Eva doesn’t answer him directly. Instead, she looks past him—toward the edge of the clearing, where Ziva now stands, watching silently beside Arabelle.

Eva starts speaking directly to them, echoing the reading she gave Ziva when she first met her: *“I am to be dead. Torn forcefully from the tapestry of fate, I am now a contingency. An anomaly. My thread is strong and weak, frayed and knotted, split and tied, broken and remade.”* 

Strahd demands again to know the identity of this final piece.

Eva tells him that the girl is neither his adversary nor his salvation. She is a singular moment the loop cannot resolve. She has the power to end everything—not by saving or destroying him, but by choosing something the Dark Powers cannot predict.

Strahd is incredulous. He accuses Eva of being willing to unmake his kingdom on nothing more than a gamble.

Eva meets his outrage with calm certainty. Not for a gamble, she says—for a possibility.

Strahd admits that he always suspected the day would come when someone would try to unwrite the page. He simply never expected it to be Eva holding the pen. He vows to find the girl, claiming control over the threads and insisting that he already has plans in motion to break the cycle himself. He cannot afford to let her test the limits now.

But Eva tells him that this is why she brought him here—because he cannot stop it, even if he can stop her. She says she is ready.

And then Strahd raises his hand—not with cruelty, but with finality—and kills her.

And every thread of fate shreds.

Back in the tree magically summoned by the coin given to the group by Jenny, the interior of the tree pulses with gentle vines of light, each strand glowing faintly as the entire structure creaks and shifts around the Shards of Dawn. The living wood seems to breathe, its motion rhythmic and organic. All around them, the deep, resonant sound of burrowing echoes through the bark—an eerie reminder of just how narrowly the party has escaped the wrath of Strahd’s brides.

Ziva and Arabelle’s screams slowly fade into silence as both collapse into unconsciousness on the floor.

Ezmeralda pounds her fists against the bark where the door had been moments before. Her voice breaks with rage, curses spilling from her lips. Everything she has buried for so long—grief, fear, betrayal—surfaces in a torrent.

Jenny watches her with mild curiosity, unmoved, while the rest of the party rushes to check on Ziva and Arabelle. Jenny casually remarks that she had been paid by van Richten weeks ago to keep an eye on the group and confirms that the coin Tian used has lost its magic.

Tian, still processing, laments that he had no idea what the coin was meant for. Jenny shrugs, reminding him that he could have simply paid her to *Identify* it.

Her gaze drifts to the two unconscious women, and with the same nonchalance, she states that they will come around.

The tree gradually slows its burrowing motion. The vines settle, and the radiant threads of light shift and flicker. A door materializes once again, and with a soft creak, it swings open to reveal the chill of Barovia’s night air. The wind rushes in—cold, earthy, and laced with the scent of pine.

As the breeze brushes against them, Ziva and Arabelle stir. Ziva rises quickly and moves to Arabelle’s side, wrapping her arms around her as the younger girl begins to sob quietly into her shoulder.

Ezmeralda looks around sharply, scanning the unfamiliar landscape and demanding to be returned immediately. After all this time searching, she refuses to accept that van Richten has been taken from her just as she found him.

Milos offers calm reassurance. He believes van Richten is still alive—that Strahd would not orchestrate such a calculated capture only to kill him without purpose.

Ez, seething and inconsolable, declares her need to release the rage building inside her. Milos offers his life without hesitation, but after a moment, she declines. It would not feel satisfying if he did not fight back.

Beyond the open doorway lies the outline of Tser’s Pool, barely visible in the moonlight. The wind carries the soft, somber lullaby of Vistani voices, humming gently through the trees.

Ezmeralda stalks away from the tree, slipping into the forest’s shadows. Once out of sight, her steps falter, and the tears begin to fall freely.

Sally follows at a distance, concerned, but Ez tries to push her away. She is not in the mood for comfort or conversation—not ready to let anyone see this raw part of herself.

Still, the words spill out in fragments. She speaks of van Richten’s deep mistrust, how he always kept her at a distance, never allowing anyone to truly help him. Now, he is going to die in that castle alone.

She is furious that he left her behind again, convinced he knows best, believing himself the only one capable of sacrifice. He walked away once before without a word, like she meant nothing—and this feels no different.

Ez’s voice cracks as she admits something deeper. She has always believed that van Richten hates the Vistani—and with reason. But she thought, perhaps foolishly, that she was an exception. That she meant something more. Now, she sees that she may have been wrong all along.

She has done everything for him, given everything—and it has never been enough.

Her voice drops to a whisper. She asks Sally to leave her alone.

Ziva quietly asks Jenny why she brought them here. Jenny responds that she has come to pay her respects—to what remains of her sister.

Arabelle gently pulls away from Ziva’s embrace and rises to her feet, her voice calm but resolute as she says they should go. Together, Jenny, Arabelle, and Ziva move into the forest, followed closely by Tian, Ireena, and Milos.

As they walk, Ziva uses the *Message* cantrip to inform Tian that Strahd is the one who killed Eva. Later, she relays the same to Ireena, who turns her attention to Arabelle in an attempt to offer comfort. Arabelle takes Ireena’s hand and assures her, softly, that everything will be all right.

The group arrives at the clearing, where Eva’s body rests peacefully among the trees. She appears serene, as if merely lost in a deep, dreamless sleep.

Jenny shuffles forward, kneeling beside Eva. With gentle hands, she adjusts Eva’s shawl and smooths her hair before beginning a prayer in an ancient, primal tongue. The words are foreign to the others, but something in them stirs a distant memory in Ziva—something buried and half-remembered, possibly connected to Galdran. The sensation slips away before she can grasp it fully.

When the prayer is done, Jenny rises and turns to the Shards of Dawn. She tells them she will wait at the tree to escort them back once they are ready. There is nothing left for her here.

Tian, staring at Eva’s still form, is suddenly struck by a strange, unnatural pain—old and aching—as though she had once meant something profound to him. The distant sound of ravens flapping through the branches echoes around them, solemn and reverent, as if the birds themselves are paying tribute.

Ziva steps forward next. She kneels beside Eva, lighting a candle and placing it at her side. She offers a quiet prayer, hoping Eva’s soul finds guidance in the afterlife, lit by the path of dawn.

Then she leans in and whispers that she understands why Eva did what she did. Had their roles been reversed, Ziva knows she might have done the same, if not worse. But even with that understanding, she cannot find it in herself to forgive Eva—at least for now.

Arabelle joins her, sitting quietly beside Eva. Her voice is soft as she reflects on what she now sees—that fate is not a chain, but a circle, always looping in spirals. She speaks of Eva’s hands and laughter as if they were her own, and reveals that Eva gave her fragments of her memory, but urged her to forge her own path.

Eva, Arabelle says, is not truly gone. She lives on in her heart and in the hearts of all who loved her. She promises to carry the Eye, and when their paths cross again, she will recognize her.

Then Arabelle turns to Ziva and tells her she wishes to stay at Tser’s Pool, to help others the way Eva once did. Ziva nods solemnly, saying she will miss having Arabelle close, but respects her decision.

Arabelle steps closer and asks if Ziva understands what Eva showed them. Ziva affirms that she does—though she needs time to fully comprehend it. They embrace, and Ziva presses a kiss to Arabelle’s forehead.

Milos steps forward, removing his bear pelt. With quiet reverence, he wraps it around Eva’s body and lifts her gently into his arms, carrying her back toward the camp.

Sally finds Jenny waiting at the perimeter. She offers a soft apology for her loss, recalling how Jenny had called Eva her sister.

Jenny, characteristically blunt, dismisses the sentiment. There is no loss, she says—Eva is now energy, returned to the earth, the trees, the wind.

Without missing a beat, she tells Sally to work on her listening. Right now, Jenny says, she’s still painfully clueless.

Milos returns to the Vistani camp carrying Eva’s body. He delivers her with solemn care to the Vistani elders, who are already making preparations for her funeral rites.

Araja, the leader of the camp, seeks out Ziva. Together, they speak of Strahd’s transgression—the breaking of his sacred pact by killing Eva, a Vistana. Araja, furious and disillusioned, leans toward withdrawing the camp’s hospitality from Strahd entirely. But Ziva urges caution. Though Strahd’s oath has been broken, she does not believe he will repeat the offense. She believes fear, not strategy, drove him—fear of what Eva had set in motion.

Ziva tells Araja that change is coming. Not only for Strahd, but for the Vistani, for the people of Barovia, and for the land itself. The world, she says, is poised on the edge of transformation. It holds its breath now, but soon it will exhale—and when it does, everything will shift.

Araja accuses her of becoming as cryptic as Eva. Ziva only smiles, admitting she really sees the appeal of being cryptic.

Before she leaves, Ziva asks for a new pack of Tarroka cards, as she currently has none. Araja, with a chuckle, hands her a deck—muttering that she truly is the worst Vistana he has ever seen.

At the edge of the forest, Milos finds Ezmeralda pacing at the forest's edge. Her tears have dried, but the storm in her eyes remains.

He asks her to travel with the Shards of Dawn. She agrees—on one condition: they must be heading to Ravenloft to rescue van Richten. Milos reminds her that in one week’s time, that is exactly what they intend to do. Until then, other matters must be addressed. He believes Strahd will keep van Richten alive, if only to toy with him.

Ez accepts the terms, agreeing to join their journey now and accompany them to Ravenloft in a week. Milos, in turn, makes a single request: when they reach the castle, she must refrain from yelling at van Richten.

Ez considers it and, with a reluctant nod, agrees.

Back in the Vistani Camp, Ziva finds Arabelle and prepares to say goodbye. She asks if she may take Eva’s crystal ball with her. Arabelle hands it over without hesitation, telling her that even though their paths are parting, they will always be able to speak.

She takes Ziva’s hand, and a subtle shift occurs in the air. Ziva closes her eyes—and when she opens them again, she finds herself standing in a white, timeless space where everything feels suspended.

Before her stands a teenage version of Arabelle. She explains that this is a safe, private place—a pocket within the astral plane. Here, they can speak freely. The link may not always work, but it will remain open when needed.

Ziva steps forward and embraces her again, whispering that she will miss her.

Later, Milos approaches Arabelle, having heard of her decision to stay behind. He has come to say goodbye.

As he hugs her, he offers a prayer to Lathander—not for himself, but for Moonshade, his celestial companion. He asks that Moonshade remain with Arabelle, to protect her in his absence.

Moonshade materializes beside them, pressing her head gently to Arabelle’s shoulder. But when she turns to Milos, her message is clear: though she likes Arabelle, her bond is to him. She will not leave his side.

Milos nods in understanding, then draws from his own magical reserves. He offers a piece of himself, sacrificing part of his essence so Arabelle can summon a companion of her own.

Magic shimmers in the air, and a radiant horse appears—younger than Moonshade, playful and proud. It approaches Arabelle and bonds with her instantly. She names her new companion *Rednaii.*

Overwhelmed with joy, Arabelle throws her arms around Milos and laughs through her tears, calling him a softie. 

Milos smiles quietly. He does not deny it. As he turns to leave, tears begin to fall from his eyes.

The two cats that once belonged to Eva—named after Ziva’s adoptive parents from Red Larch—approach Ziva, curling around her legs in a final gesture of farewell. Rina steps forward, promising to care for them in Eva’s absence.

When Ziva asks if she’s holding up, Rina admits she isn’t. Eva has been a constant presence in the camp for as long as she can remember.

Ziva offers quiet comfort, reminding her that Eva is not truly gone—she lives on in the memories of those who knew and loved her.

Ziva then asks Rina about Milos, Ezmeralda, and Stefan of the Kaldreshi tribe—the souls the Shards of Dawn encountered before Ludmilla ended their lives. But Rina has no memory of ever meeting them.

Just then, Arabelle appears on her new steed, Rednaii—the magical horse gifted to her by Milos. She proudly announces the gift, and the party immediately begins to tease Milos about his hidden soft side.

With farewells shared, the Shards of Dawn gather their things and leave the camp behind.

The Shards of Dawn, joined by Ezmeralda, step once again into the heart of Jenny’s living tree. Within its pulsing, vine-woven interior, Jenny casually asks where they wish to go next.

Ezmeralda is quick to speak, suggesting they return to the place they came from—her caravan remains there.

Ziva, pausing at the threshold, asks Jenny if she has any advice for the road ahead. Jenny offers her usual cryptic counsel: avoid Krezk. And the Wizard of Wines. And definitely avoid Berez. Still, she knows the party won’t listen. She also hints that they may encounter her other sister, Laura Stoneheart, during their travels.

The tree shudders and begins to burrow, transporting the party beneath the earth.

When it emerges, they find themselves just outside van Richten’s tower. The surrounding land is scarred—craters dot the ground and lakewater spills into them. The tower itself appears battered and fractured, bearing the wounds of the recent conflict.

Ezmeralda’s rage still simmers beneath the surface, and Ziva steps forward, placing a firm hand on her shoulder. With a quiet vow, she assures Ezmeralda that justice will be served—the brides will not escape what is coming to them.

As the party exits the tree, offering thanks, Ziva lingers behind. She bows slightly and addresses Jenny with respect, calling her “Huntress.” Jenny scoffs at the title, dismissing its weight and warning Ziva not to invest too much meaning in names. She remarks that the Rozanas are long dead—nothing more than husks, clinging to a world that no longer belongs to them.

Tian mutters about the ever-growing number of secrets within the group, frustration creeping into his voice.

Sally remains behind for a moment, asking Jenny if the magic of the moving tree can be learned. Jenny tells her it can—but only if she first becomes truly skilled in her craft.

Sally thanks her but admits uncertainty about her path. Jenny, characteristically blunt, declares them all doomed, then turns on her heel and slams the door shut.

With a quiet hiss, the door vanishes. The tree fades from existence, leaving the Shards of Dawn alone in front of the ravaged shell of van Richten’s tower.

Ezmeralda disappears into the woods to retrieve her caravan, while Tian and Milos ascend to the tower’s upper level to search for anything van Richten might have left behind.

Below, Sally approaches Ziva and asks why she bowed to Jenny and called her “Huntress.” Ziva explains that Jenny is—or was—a Rozana. She reveals that Eva carried the last remnants of the Seeker, and that Jenny had referred to her as “sister.” The ancient, primal language Jenny used while paying her respects further confirmed her identity.

Ziva also shares that Jenny was angered by Sally’s resistance to embracing her purpose: healing the land. Sally scoffs, unsure of how to even begin, but Ziva lays out the facts. The party knows Strahd corrupted the fanes—the sacred sites tied to the Rozanas—and redirected their power to himself, becoming bound to the land. Those shrines must be visited. Once there, Sally can attempt to connect with the latent natural magic and purify the corruption, just as she did with Stella.

Ziva believes that cleansing the fanes will sever Strahd’s connection to the land, making him vulnerable. The two briefly joke about Strahd’s dramatic tendency to proclaim “I am the land” whenever he introduces himself.

Ezmeralda returns shortly afterward and, with a competitive glint, begins scaling the tower wall, challenging Ziva to keep up. Refusing to be outdone, Ziva casts *Control Water*, summoning a powerful waterspout that lifts herself, Sally, and Ireena to the top. They reach the summit just before Ezmeralda, beating her by a narrow margin.

The Shards of Dawn begin a careful search of the chamber. Several items glow faintly with magic, prompting Ezmeralda to caution the others—magical traps are a possibility, and haste could prove dangerous.

Tian discovers an old teleportation circle etched into the floor. With Sally’s assistance, they disarm the arcane trap surrounding it and uncover a hidden compartment. Inside, they find:

* A map of Barovia  
* A collection of scrolls  
* Several silvered daggers  
* A small, enchantment-sealed box

Ziva examines the drawers of van Richten’s desk and locates a concealed compartment. Within it lie:

* A single Sending Stone, its pair missing  
* A ring of keys

Ezmeralda moves toward the bookshelf, with Ziva joining her. Together, they uncover a collection of valuable tomes:

* A set of Vistani novels, which prove to be a magical disguise concealing van Richten’s personal journal, detailing Strahd’s patterns and behaviors  
* ***Van Richten’s Guide to Vampires***, marked with the scholar’s own annotations—edits not found in any known edition  
* A macabre volume titled ***Of the Night and Its Children***, reeking faintly of embalming fluid. Ziva suspects this book may be banned from most literary circles  
* ***Fates Entwined***, penned by a seer  
* ***The Herbalist’s Last Stand***, which Ezmeralda quickly snatches from Ziva, claiming it for herself without hesitation

Meanwhile, Milos and Ireena sit quietly on the couch, passing the time by knitting a rose together—an unexpectedly gentle moment in the midst of tense discoveries.

Tian and Sally examine the small enchanted box found in the hidden compartment, attempting to decipher how it opens. Tian retrieves the ring of keys Ziva discovered and, selecting one at random, inserts it into the lock. A sudden pulse of purple energy surges through the room. When it fades, Tian appears dazed and unrecognizable—his thoughts and demeanor scattered. He has been Feebleminded.

Confused and disoriented, Tian takes to the air, fluttering around like a startled bird. Ziva, alarmed by his erratic behavior, attempts to draw him back to the tower by casting a radiant glow upon her shield. The light catches his attention. He dives like a raptor, not to return, but to snatch the shield from her.

Milos reacts quickly, grappling Tian and forcing the Dread Helm onto his head—backwards—to block his vision. But contact with Tian burns Milos’s skin, forcing him to release his grip. Tian wrests the shield free and escapes into the sky once again. With surprising strength, he tears the helm from his head and tosses it into the lake below. Then, he lands atop the tower and begins constructing a nest.

Ziva urges the others to avoid the small box, convinced that it is cursed. Ezmeralda challenges her—demanding to know how Ziva intends to unlock it if they don’t experiment. Ziva, unwilling to risk another mind-shattering effect, holds the box out of reach while the debate continues.

Meanwhile, Sally dispels the magic on a nearby chest. Inside, she uncovers:

* A \+1 magical silver shortsword  
* Alchemical gear and powders  
* Monster hunter equipment

Drawn back to the small box, Sally and Milos manage to snatch it from Ziva’s hands. The two engage in a quick game of boulder-parchment-shears to determine who will try the next key. Sally wins. She inserts the chosen key, and once more, a pulse of purple energy floods the room. When she looks up, her expression is vacant—her mind also shattered by the curse.

Ziva, trying to calm her, offers a mummified head from her Bag of Holding for Sally to play with. Sally promptly destroys it, losing interest almost immediately.

With the correct key now identified, Milos opens the box. Inside, he finds:

* A bundle of letters  
* A sharpening stone

Ezmeralda lets out a disbelieving breath. The sharpening stone had once been hers—years ago. Without hesitation, she throws it at the mirror in the corner. The glass shatters, revealing a hidden cache containing:

* Pages of what appear to be van Richten’s private reflections  
* A black beeswax candle adorned with silver filigree

Milos skims through the pages and realizes they contain heartfelt thoughts van Richten had written about Ezmeralda. Quietly, he chooses to keep them to himself for now.

Meanwhile, Ziva continues trying to coax Tian back inside. Observing his nest-building, she casts *Minor Illusion*, conjuring the image of a beautiful, bright pink female aarakocra. Entranced, Tian follows the illusion into the tower, performing a little mating dance for the phantom. Milos seizes the opportunity, grappling him once more and hogtying him to prevent another escape.
