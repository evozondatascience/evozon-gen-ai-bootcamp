    "Think of this as your AI that can:\n",
    "- 🌤️ Check the weather in real-time\n",
    "- 👔 Browse through clothing options \n",
    "- 🧠 Make smart decisions combining weather + event type\n",
    "- 💬 Remember your conversation across multiple chats\n",

    "This isn't just a chatbot that gives pre-written responses. We're building an **agent** that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use tools** to gather real information (weather data and wardrobe options)\n",
    "2. **Make intelligent decisions** based on that information\n",
    "3. **Remember context** across multiple interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you'll understand how to create AI systems that can interact with the real world!\n",

      "Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that possess a degree of agency—that is, the capability to act autonomously, make decisions, and pursue goals in an environment without constant human intervention. Unlike passive AI systems that only respond to specific inputs or perform predefined tasks, agentic AI can perceive its surroundings, reason about possible actions, and execute plans to achieve objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key characteristics of agentic AI include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Autonomy:** The ability to operate independently and make decisions on its own.\n",
      "- **Goal-directed behavior:** Pursuing specific objectives or tasks.\n",
      "- **Perception and reasoning:** Understanding the environment and using that information to inform actions.\n",
      "- **Adaptability:** Adjusting behavior based on changes in the environment or new information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agentic AI is often discussed in the context of advanced AI systems such as intelligent agents, autonomous robots, or AI-driven software that can manage complex tasks, learn from experience, and interact dynamically with humans and other systems.\n",

    "# Conclusion: Building Effective AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've now built a complete agentic AI system with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool integration** for accessing external data sources\n",
    "2. **ReAct pattern** for multi-step reasoning\n",
    "3. **Persistent memory** for maintaining context across conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tools extend capabilities**: Tools allow LLMs to access external data and perform specific functions\n",
    "2. **Graph-based reasoning**: LangGraph enables structured flows with conditional logic\n",
    "3. **Memory is crucial**: Persistent state allows for true conversational experiences\n",
    "4. **System prompts matter**: The persona and instructions shape how the agent behaves\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps for Further Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add more tools**: Integrate additional capabilities like calendar access, note-taking, etc.\n",
    "2. **Implement persistent storage**: Replace MemorySaver with SQLite or Redis for true persistence\n",
    "3. **Add human feedback**: Implement human feedback loops to improve agent responses\n",
    "4. **Add structured output**: Return structured JSON for integration with other systems\n",
    "5. **Deploy as a service**: Wrap the agent in an API for broader application integration"
